The neighbour looked over the partition between their flats and saw PP masturbating and moving his finger up and down underneath the victim's shorts. 5. Section 207 (1) of the Crimes decree, 2009 clearly provides; "207 (1) Any person who rapes another person commits an indictable offence. Penalty Imprisonment for life." 6.
