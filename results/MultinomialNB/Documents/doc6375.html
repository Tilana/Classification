In so far as it applies, section 197 (2) of the Penal Code states: "(2) Any person who enters by night any dwelling-house, or any verandah or passage attached thereto, or any yard, garden or other land adjacent to or within the cartilage of such dwelling-house, without lawful excuse, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for one year". 13. The prosecution must prove the following elements: a. The accused; b. Entered by night without lawful excuse; c. The dwelling house of the complainant (PW1). 14. As far as section 244 of the Penal Code, it states: "244-Any person who unlawfully assaults another is guilty of a misdemeanour, and, if the assault is not committed in circumstances for which a greater punishment is provided in this Code, is liable to imprisonment for one year. 15. For the offence of common assault the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: a. The accused; b. Unlawfully assaulted the complainant. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE 16. Since the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charges it is the duty of the prosecution to prove each of the elements of the charges beyond reasonable doubt. 17. The accused is charged with one count of criminal trespass and one count of common assault. 18. As stated above, PW1 stated in evidence that he saw the accused at his compound that night and when he (PW1) asked what's he doing there, he then punched him on head, eyes and broke his eye glasses [Ex1]. 19. PW1 explained to court how he identified the accused. He said that there were school lights falling into his compound, for he identified the accused clearly by recognition. The accused is his nephew. After the punch he felt dizzy and sat down. He called out his wife and told her what had happened. 20. Under cross examination PW1 confirmed that he identified the accused in the school light that night. He also said that the school is very close to his compound. 21. PW2 in evidence stated that she saw the accused that night just before the assaulting incident. When she asked what he is doing there he left. She told that she identified the accused in the school lights. After sometime her husband called her out and told "Sarwan assaulted him and his eye glasses broken". 22. Under cross examination she told that just before the assaulting incident she saw the accused at their compound that night. She confirmed that after that her husband, PW1 called her out and told that Sarwan assaulted and his eye glasses broken. 23. Both PW1 and PW2 stated that they saw the accused that night, by 8.30 pm at their compound and they indentified the accused by recognition. 24. PW1 told that the accused punched him that night on the head, eyes and the eye glasses broke. He called out PW2 immediately after assaulting and told Sarwan assaulted and his eye glasses broke. It is to be noted that the accused has been identified by name. 25. Though PW1 was examined by a doctor. The prosecution could not produce any medical report. The charge on the second count is one of common assault. The offence of common assault may be proved even without medical examination report, for the prosecution need not prove any injury to establish an offence of common assault. What the prosecution need to prove for a common assault that the accused assaulted the victim. 26. In the caution interview and the charge statement the accused had denied the both allegations. He did not make any statements regarding the allegations. At trial the accused had chosen to remain silent. He has just exercised his common law right to remain silent. The court cannot draw any adverse inference for that. 27. PW1 gave forthright evidence in court. PW2 confirmed what PW1 told in evidence. Their evidence was not shaken in cross examination. Prosecution witnesses were consistence in their evidence. 28. PW1 and PW2 clearly identified the accused by name in the school lights that night. The accused had trespassed into the compound of the complainant without any excuse and he assaulted and broke PW1's eye glasses. 29. The prosecution witnesses gave plausible evidence hence I accept their evidence. 30. The prosecution was successful in proving each element of the both charges beyond reasonable doubt. 31. I therefore find the accused guilty on both charges, criminal trespass and common assault and convict him accordingly.
