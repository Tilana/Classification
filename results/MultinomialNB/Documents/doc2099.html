AND: IN THE MATTER of the Companies Act. RULING Introduction [1]. On 14th April 2010, FRESH'ET INTERNATIONAL LIMITED a company having its registered office at 131 Foster Road ("Fresh'et") filed a petition to wind-up ARTS VILLAGE LIMITED ("AVL"). Fresh'et alleges in the petition that ATL is indebted to it in the sum of $11,563.47 in respect of goods sold to AVL by Fresh'et. [2]. The Affidavit Verifying Petition was filed on 21st April 2010. An Affidavit of Service of Muni Prasad sworn on 03rd of May 2010 deposes that he served the petition on AVL on 23rd April 2010 at Shop 13, Arts Village Limited, Pacific Harbour, Deuba which, according to Prasad, is AVL's registered office. [3]. The petition was duly advertised in the Fiji Sun on Thursday May 13th 2010 and in the Gazette Notice on 21st May 2010, as shown in the Memorandum of Due Compliance filed on 25th May 2010. [4]. A Notice of Intention to Appear and Support Petition was filed by Vodafone Fiji Limited on 7th June 2010 for an alleged debt of $3,574.29. PriceWaterhouseCoopers also filed a similar Notice on 2nd June 2010 on the basis of an alleged debt of $104, 361.50. [5]. As AVL has not bothered to file an affidavit in opposition let alone appear in Court, I granted Order in Terms of the Petition on 16th July 2010 and awarded $500-00 costs in favour of the petitioner and $150 costs in favour of the supporting creditors who had been appearing by their solicitor.
