Bulamainaivalu for State Mr. N. Vere for 1st and 2nd Accused Hearing: 4th September 2003 Ruling: 4th September 2003 RULING The procedure for tendering a previous inconsistent statement is this. The witness must be shown the statement and asked to identify the record. Once identified the witness must be asked to read or have read to him, the alleged inconsistency. Having heard the witnesss reaction to such inconsistency, the cross-examining party may ask the statement to be exhibited as a previous inconsistent statement. That procedure was followed in this case although the witness identified only his signatures. The statement was relevant and admissible and was properly tendered.
