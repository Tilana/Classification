The complainants in this matter are Shyam Lal (PW1), 53 years old, farmer of Ellington, Rakiraki and Doreen Lata (PW2), 27 years old, Clerical Officer, also of Ellington, Rakiraki. PW1 is residing with his wife, son namely Ashnil Lal (PW3) and his wife PW2 and their child at Ellington, Rakiraki. On the 4th day of November 2013, at about 1.30am, after the Diwali celebration, PW1 and his entire family members went off to bed, all windows and doors locked, with the lights switched off. Sometimes between 1.30am to 3.50am, the accused entered the dwelling house of PW1 by removing the louver blades from the sitting room. He entered into the house and notice that everyone in the house was asleep. He entered into PW1's prayer room, took some money from there and fled the house with the following items: 1. 1 x Forme phone with charger valued at $100.00 2. $55.00 cash 3. $10.00 worth of Grog 4. 1 x Acer Laptop valued $2,306.94 5. $60.00 cash.

The matter was reported to Rakiraki Police Station. During investigations, the police received information that someone was trying to pawn the laptop.

After carefully considering your Plea to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for one count of burglary and two counts of theft and accordingly you are convicted under Section 312 (1) and Section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree respectively. 5. You stand convicted for Burglary and Theft. 6. Section 312 (1) prescribes a maximum sentence of 13 years imprisonment for aggravated burglary. 7. Section 291 (1) prescribes maximum sentence of 10 years for the offence of Theft. 8. Considering the tariff for the offence of Burglary in Tabeusi v StateHAC 95-113/2010 and Mucunabitu v State HAC 17 of 2010, the Court accepted between 18 months to 3 years as tariff. 9. Tariff for the offence of theft was discussed in several cases. In Saukilagi v State [2005] FJHC 13 HAC 0021/2004 (27 January 2005)the Court accepted between 2 to 9 months as tariff for simple theft. "The tariff for simple larceny on first conviction is 2-9 months (Ronald Vikash Singh v. State HAA 035 of 2002) and on second conviction a sentence in excess of 9 months. In cases of the larceny of large amounts of money sentences of 1 years imprisonment (IsoaCodrokadroka v. State Crim. App. HAA 67 of 2002) and 3 years imprisonment have been upheld by the High Court (Sevanaia Via Koroi v. State Crim. App. HAA 031 of 2001S). Much depends on the value of the money stolen, and the nature of the relationship between victim and the defendant. The method of stealing is also relevant." 10. You have 6 previous convictions. 11. Considering the nature of the offence and all other circumstances, I commence your sentence for the 1stcount at 24 months. 12. State had submitted following aggravating factors: (a) You broke into a domestic house by removing 3 louver blades while the family members were fast asleep and value of items stolen is $ 2,521.94 13. I increase your sentence by 6 months for the above aggravating factor. Now your sentence is 30 months. 14. Mitigating circumstances of the accused are: (a) You are married and wife is 9 months pregnant. (b) You are remorseful. (c) Items to the value of $2306.94 were recovered. 15. I deduct 6 months for the above mitigating factors. Now your sentence is 24 months. 16. I deduct 8 months for the guilty plea. Now your sentence is 16 months. 17. You have been in remand from 8th November 2013. I deduct 7 months for that period. Now your sentence is 9 months. 18. I take a starting point of 18 months in respect of each theft charge against the accused. I add 3 months for the aggravating circumstances and deduct 6 months for mitigating circumstances. Further I deduct 5 months for the Guilty plea. Then the sentence is 10 months. When the time period in remand is deducted the sentence is 3 months. 19. All the offences stated above were committed in the course of same transaction, therefore, I order all sentences to run concurrently. Summary; 20. You are sentenced as follows: 1st Charge of Burglary - 9 months 2nd Charge of Theft - 3 months 3rd Charge of Theft - 3 months 21. Although you do not deserve a suspended sentence considering your previous convictionsconsidering the fact that your wife is 9 months pregnant and you are the sole bread winner, this Court will give you a final chance to rehabilitate by suspending the operation of all these sentences for a period of 3 years. 22. The suspended sentence is explained to the accused. 23. 30 days to appeal Sudharshana De Silva JUDGE AT LAUTOKA 17th June 2014 Solicitors for the State: Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, Lautoka Solicitors for the Accused: Accused Inperson</p></div></div></body></html>
