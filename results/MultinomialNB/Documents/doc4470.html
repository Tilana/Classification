Sharma ] for the Respondents Wilfred Golman ] for the Human Rights Sonanatabua Colovanua ] Commission Tupou Draunidali ] for the Citizens Constitutional Forum Limited Date of Ruling: Thursday, 9th April 2009, Suva RULING OF THE COURT IN QARASE v BAINIMARAMA 1. Counsel for the respondents made an application for a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and a stay pending determination of that appeal. 2. Leave to appeal was granted. The case raises unarguably questions of significant public importance. 3. This is not, however, an appropriate case for the grant of a stay. The relief which has been granted is declaratory relief. There is no irremediable prejudice threatened to the subject matter of the action. The decision may cause some public disquiet because of its constitutional importance but that has no relevance to the exercise by the Court of its discretion to grant a stay. 4. In any event the President, who is not a party to these proceedings, has certain obligations under section 60 of the Constitution which are not part of the original subject matter of this suit. If the President appoints a caretaker Prime Minister as contemplated by our reasons for judgment before the Supreme Court can hear the matter, these matters can be revisited. 5. The application is refused. Randall Powell Justice of Appeal Ian Lloyd Justice of Appeal Francis Douglas Justice of Appeal</p></div></div></body></html>
