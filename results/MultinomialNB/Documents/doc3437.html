CAV0004OF 2005S (Fiji Court of Appeal No. AAU0025 of 2004S) BETWEEN: ELIKI MOTOTABUA Petitioner AND: THE STATE Respondent Coram: The Hon Justice Keith Mason, Judge of the Supreme Court The Hon Justice Kenneth Handley, Judge of the Supreme Court The Hon Justice Ronald Sackville, Judge of the Supreme Court Hearing: Wednesday 23rd July 2008, Suva Counsel: Petitioner in Person Mr A. Elliot for the Respondent Date of Judgment: Wednesday 23rd July 2008, Suva JUDGMENT OF THE COURT [1] This application is an abuse of process. The matter was heard fully in the February Session and it was dismissed. The document filed on 2 May 2008 describes itself as an application for leave to file 25 additional grounds. None of them raises any new matter. Most of them involve a contemptuous canvassing of this Courts reasons. There is a passing reference to s.122(5) of the Constitution, which empowers this Court to review an earlier order. However nothing has occurred since February 2008 justifying an application to exercise such jurisdiction. [2] We were told today that the applicant wishes to challenge his sentence. He has not yet done so in the Court of Appeal. Whether that Court would entertain an application to do so at this time is a matter for it. This Court has not addressed the matter of sentence. [3] The petition is dismissed, and the Court orders that no further petition or application relevant to conviction be filed in this matter in the Supreme Court without the leave of a Judge of the High Court which may be granted or refused in Chambers without an oral hearing. Hon Justice Keith Mason Judge of the Supreme Court Hon Justice Kenneth Handley Judge of the Supreme Court Hon Justice Ronald Sackville Judge of the Supreme Court Solicitors: Petitioner in Person Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Suva for the Respondent</p></div></div></body></html>
