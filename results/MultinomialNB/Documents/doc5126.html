HBC 185 of 2008 BETWEEN: UDAY RAJ SEN f/n Bir Sen, as Attorney for SARAS WATI of Flat 12, Cakabau Apartments, Suva in the Republic of Fiji Islands, General Manger Business Development and Lending. PLAINTIFF AND: MANISHA VANDHANA f/n Satya Nand) of 24 Burerua Rd, Raiwaqa, Suva in the Republic of Fiji Islands, Dentist. 1st DEFENDANT AND: PREM LATA NARAYAN (f/n Deo Narayan) t/as PREM NARAYAN, a law firm of Module 2A, Level 2, Provident Plaza One, Ellery Street, Suva in the Republic of Fiji Islands, Solicitor. 2nd DEFENDANT BEFORE: Master Deepthi Amaratunga COUNSEL: Mr. R. Naidu of Naidu Law for the Plaintiff Mr. P. Narayan and Ms. Basawaqa A. of Munro Leys for the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant Date of Hearing: 21st November, 2011 Date of Ruling: 07th December, 2011 Decision SECOND DEFENDANT'S TAXATION OF BILL OF COSTS A. INTRODUCTION 1. This is the taxation of a bill of costs filed on 22 May 2006 for $3,311.72. 2. The Second Defendant is a lawyer who practices as a legal practitioner and 1st Defendant who ran a business venture for dental surgery with partnership with the Plaintiff, deposited money of the said joint venture in the solicitor's trust account after the relationship between the partners were strained. 3. The Plaintiff filed an action against the 1st and 2nd Defendant, but later withdrew the whole action subject to an order of the cost to be agreed and if not to be taxed. This order was made on 23rd February,2011 4. The Court made an Order of the court on costs made on 23 February 2009 was as follows: 'By consent leave is granted to the Plaintiff to discontinue the action against the Second Defendant with costs if not agreed to be taxed.' 5. The relevant law in such an instance is found in Order 62 rule 12(1) which sate where the order is silent as to the basis of the cost the cost has to be calculated on standard basis. Order 62 r 12 (1) of the High Court Rules of 1988 states as follows: On a taxation of costs on the standard basis there shall be allowed a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonable incurred and any doubts which the taxing officer may have as to whether the costs were reasonable incurred or were reasonable in amount and may be resolved in favour of the paying party; and in these rules the term "the standard basis" in relation to the taxation of costs shall be construed accordingly. (emphasis is added) 6. In Vitiana Timbers (Fiji) Limited v Danzas AEI Limited HBC 327 of 2007, the court has considered what "reasonable" meant. It was cited the case of Francis v Francis and Dickinson [1955] 3 All ER 836 "a reasonable step is that of a sensible solicitor considering in his knowledge what was reasonable for his client". The test is what the court thinks reasonable and not the actual cost as in the indemnity cost. 7. Further the phrase "necessarily incurred" was considered by the High Court, in Shah v Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority and anr HBJ 42 of 2001, 11 May 2006 where he cited Smith v Buller [1875] EQ 473, Sir Malins VC at 475 stated: I think he ought not bear more than the necessary costs. I adhere to the rule, which has already been laid down, that the costs chargeable under a taxation between party and party are all that are necessary to enable the adverse party to conduct the litigation, and no more. Any charges merely for conducting litigation more conveniently may be called luxuries, and must be paid by the party incurring it. The Plaintiff, is the attacking party and has failed, and he must therefore pay all charges which are necessary to the litigation. 8. The Second Defendant is first defendant's solicitor and ought not to have been included as a defendant in these proceedings merely because of the fact that she had deposited money given by her client which were part of the proceeds of the partnership where the Plaintiff and 1st Defendants were the estranged partners, at that time. 9. This action against the Second Defendant was not withdrawn until 23 February 2009. The action was filled on 28th May, 2008 and the 2nd Defendant state that all the claims listed below are therefore reasonable and necessarily incurred to allow the Second Defendant to defend herself in these proceedings, but the Plaintiff for obvious reasons object to all the claims except the fees paid for disbursements, filing ect. 10. Looking closely to the said claims for cost, some of the claims are not necessarily incurred and some of them are exaggerated so while considering the objection by the Plaintiff I have exercised my discretion in terms of the Order 62 rule 13 read with gazette notification of 7th July, 2006 ( Schedule 1 of Legal Practitioners Act 1997) and it should also be noted where there is a doubt as to the reasonableness it has to be decided in favour of the paying party, namely the Plaintiff in this case, and accordingly the some of the costs claimed are rejected or reduced. 11. It is also noted that standard cost has a higher and lower scales and the determinant factors in lower and higher scales are contained in Order 62 rule 13 and they are as follows a. The complexity of the item or the cause or matter in which it arises and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved. b. The skill, specialized knowledge and responsibility required of and the time and labour expended by the solicitor c. The number and importances in which the business involved is transacted d. The place and circumstances in which the business involved is transacted e. The importance of the cause or matter to the client f. Where money or property is involved, its amount or value. g. Any other fees and allowance payable to the solicitor in respect of other items in the same cause or matter, but only where work done in relation to those items has reduced the work which would otherwise have been necessary in relation to the item in question. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case the above factors (a) to (g) it is decided to measure at lower scale considering the scope of the action and the circumstances relating to it. 12. The Plaintiff has taken objection to the Second Defendant's Bill and these are noted in the table below with and order of the court at the last column.
