Epeli Koroi Suguta Before: Chaitanya Lakshman Resident Magistrate For Prosecution : PC Chetty Accused : Present In Person Date of Hearing : 9th September 2011 Judgment Introduction The accused is charged for being: "Drunk and Disorderly, contrary to Section 4 of the Minor Offences Act, Cap 18". The particulars of the offence reads: "Epeli Koroi Suguta on the 18th day of November 2010 at Sigatoka in the Western Division were (sic) drunk and disorderly in a public place namely Korotogo back Road" The Law Section 4 of the Minor Offences Act, Cap 18 provides that "any person who is drunk and disorderly in any public place or who behaves in a disorderly manner therein shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction for a first offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month and on conviction for a second offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, and on conviction for a third or subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year." Burden and Standard of proof The burden of proof in this case is on the Prosecution, the State. The Prosecution is required to prove all the elements of the charge the accused is charged with beyond reasonable doubt. If the defence establishes to the Court's satisfaction that there is reasonable doubt, then the prosecution fails. Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions, in commenting on the proof beyond reasonable doubt stated: "it need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.". The Evidence Evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses The Prosecution called 2 witnesses: Pw-1 Constable 2222 Isikeli Tasere, and Pw-2 Constable 2742 Joe Willy.

Accused drank with me that night." Re-Examination Nil. Analysis of the Evidence The Court has scrutinized all the evidence of all the witnesses in this case. The accused was unrepresented in this case. The accused in his evidence in Court did not deny that he swore at the police officers or that he had beer that night. The accused told the Court that he was ill treated and sworn at and he swore back at the complainants (the Police Officers). The accused's allegation that he was slapped by the police officer is supported by the evidence of the other defence witness. This witness was not discredited, he was truthful that he was a friend of the accused, the accused asked him to be a witness and that they had drunk that night. One point that the Court notes is crucial in this case is that the accused, who was drinking at the bus shelter went to the police post after he was asked to disperse. This is not even disputed by the Police officers. According to the accused he wanted to ask the Police why they had slapped and kicked him. The Court believes the accused. The accused went to the Police Post to see someone. When he went in no one was there. He went away. On his way back he saw the officers again. He went past them and kept quiet. Even the officers asked him what he wanted but the accused kept quiet. Would a person who is drunk and disorderly demonstrate such behaviour? The accused was controlled. He wanted answers he got none as no one was at the Police Post to assist him. The Court noted the demeanor of all witnesses. The Court noted that the prosecution witnesses tried to be consistent. They were not truthful and telling the full story why a civilian would go to the police post after being asked to leave from a public place he was alleged to have been drinking at. The Court believes the accused version of events that he was assaulted and that he wanted to find out from the Police Post why they did that to him. The Police Officers are not believed. The accused's version is believed by this Court. He has been truthful in Court. He did not deny he swore back when he was sworn at. It is a natural reaction if someone swears one will occasionally in such scenarios swear back. Also the Court believes the accused and his witness's version that the accused was assaulted. The Court is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence tendered as to the accused's guilt. The accused is acquitted of the charge. 28 Days to appeal.
