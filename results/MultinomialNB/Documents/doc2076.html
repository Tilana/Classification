Matter adjourned to 24th September, 2004 at 9.30am for mention before Justice Winter. 24th September, 2004 Petitioners counsel withdraws the winding up petition. Court reserves the issue of costs. 6th October, 2004 Respondents counsel writes to Petitioners solicitor on the issue of costs but does not receive any response. 29th October, 2004 Present application filed. This chronology was not disputed at the hearing. Statutory Demands The purpose of statutory demands is frequently misunderstood. Its prime purpose is to act as a foundation for winding up a companys affairs. It is in effect a summary process that must be treated with care. It is not a debt collection procedure. If the debt is doubtful the procedure should not be used, rather, the petitioner should first prove his debt by obtaining judgment then based on that court order present a statutory demand. If a creditor is told by a company against which it has served statutory demand that the company disputes the demand then the petitioning creditor proceeds against that company at its peril. There are numerous authorities which emphasize the principle that the issuing of a statutory demand is a serious step which imposes considerable strain on the recipient. The recipient of a statutory demand must act within a very short time frame if it is to avoid committing an act which gives rise to the power to have it placed in liquidation. It must also act quickly to protect its credit and reputation in the market. As a result courts have been prepared to make significant awards of costs against persons who invoke the procedure in inappropriate cases. See for example Eberk Construction Limited v Advanced Windows Limited, [2001] 14 PRNZ at 681 and Ordeal Enterprises Limited and Callan Healthcare Properties Limited, in an unreported decision of Associate Judge Lang in the High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry M1552-IM02. The petitioning creditor received a letter from the recipient company dated the 5th of March 2004 that disputed the validity of the issue of the statutory demand. The demand for payment was made to the wrong company. That letter indicates at the bottom of the first page that at the time of its preparation the recipient company had received a winding up notice from the petitioning creditors solicitors. The affidavit of service indicates that the petition was served on the 2nd of March 2004. A further letter was sent by the recipient companys solicitors again explaining the simple fact that the demand was sent to the wrong company. It further invited the petitioner to prove its claim in court before proceeding further. Despite that correspondence the petitioning creditor elected to proceed with the petition throughout appearances in June, July, August, the 3rd of September and finally on the 24th of September where it only then elected to withdraw the petition. In this case a large multi-national oil company of undoubted and significant resource was ignorant of the recipients rights. Despite being told that the demand notice was invalid the petitioning creditor elected to proceed. It only withdrew its petition some months later. In my view, the petitioning creditors use of the statutory demand procedure was inappropriate. The delay in the withdrawal of the petition significantly increased the recipient companys costs of defence. Indemnity Costs Indemnity costs can be awarded in appropriate circumstances. The Supreme Court of South Australia gave some guidelines for the consideration of indemnity costs in a decision of Taylor v Santos & Others, [1999] SASC 430. The relevant principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs set out at paragraph 9 of that judgment are: Solicitor and client costs may be awarded where a party should have known it had no chance of success &&&& Such costs have been awarded in cases where the trial judge indicates that: (a) the case was misconceived (b) the plaintiff had lost on virtually every issue (c) the relief claimed in the summons was defective (d) the difficulties in the plaintiffs claim had been pointed out prior to trial (e) the partys case was falsely and deliberately concocted (f) the party prevaricated in the witness box to prolong the litigation (g) fragmentary and unconvincing evidence was adduced by a party with a lack of substance in its case and like grounds (h) there was re-litigation of issues already determined. For the purposes of determination whether or not indemnity costs should be awarded when the statutory demand process has been wrongly evoked I would add a consideration of whether the petitioning creditor was careless in commencing or continuing with the petition. I find that the use of the statutory demand process was misconceived. I find that the petitioning creditor was advised of the reasons for that misconception earlier on and yet elected to continue with petitioning for the recipient company to be wound up. As I have earlier said in this judgment there are numerous authorities which emphasize the principle that the issuing of a statutory demand is a serious step which imposes considerable strain on the recipient. It follows that the recipient should not be left out of pocket if the petitioning process fails. In my view there was no justification at all for BP (Southwest) Pacific Limited to proceed with the petition in the light of the information it was clearly provided by the recipient company. The situation was further aggravated by months of delay before the withdrawal of that petition. That delay undoubtedly added to the recipient companys costs. Notwithstanding that finding and not without some hesitation I have concluded that it would not be appropriate in the present circumstances to award indemnity costs. I am principally persuaded to this view because I accept the petitioning creditor counsels submissions that it initially thought when preparing the demand notice that it correctly identified the recipient company. Further, having been advised that the statutory demand was invalid there then is some understandable delay before the petition was withdrawn as BP (Southwest) Pacific Limited despite having a registered office in Suva apparently has to report to a parent company before being able to issue instructions. However, at the very most that process should have only created a delay of a week or more. In these circumstances I am satisfied though that this is an appropriate case for an award of increased costs in Aggressor Fiji Limiteds favour. In my view it would be appropriate for BP (Southwest) Pacific Limited to meet 75% of Aggressor (Fiji) Limited actual costs. Order I therefore make an order that BP (Southwest) Pacific Limited pay the global sum of $1,860.00 towards Aggressor (Fiji) Limited for costs and disbursements in relation to the petition. I further order that BP (Southwest) Pacific Limited pay the sum of $500.00 costs in relation to this application as a global sum to cover all costs and disbursements.
