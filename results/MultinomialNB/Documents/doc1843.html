He was charged for one count of House Breaking with intend to Commit a Felony contrary to Section 302(2) of the Penal Code Act 17. [02] Appellant appearing in person pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted the summary of facts. He has also pleaded guilty to five other cases. (1373/07, 1602/07, 1603/07, 1604/07and 522/09) [03] On 29/01/2013 he was sentenced to a prison term of 7 years for File No: 1605/07 with concurrent to File Nos: 1602/07, 1603/07 and 1604/07. [04] Being aggrieved by the above sentence the Appellant has appealed against the sentence imposed in File No: 1605/07. Tariff for the Offence [05] Madam Shameem J in her appeal judgment in Mesake Ratabua v The State Crim. Appeal No:026 of 2004S cited Tomasi Turuturuvesi v State Crim. App HAA86/2002S stating that the tariff for house breaking entering and larceny was between 18 months to 3 years imprisonment, the question of suspending being reserved for the young first offender. [06] In the Appeal decision of Madam Shameem J Epeli Labalaba v State Crim. Appeal No: HAA 013 of 2005S, reduced a 12 months sentence to 9 months for the offence of School Breaking With Intend to Commit Felony. [07] Considering the above decisions, in this case File No;1605/07,the Learned Magistrate had imposed a maximum sentence of 7 years under Section 302(2) of the Penal Code, Cap 17 disregarding accepted tariff. [08] At the hearing the counsel for the Appellant submitted to this court that the Appellant would be satisfied if the sentence passed in File No: 1605/7 is brought under accepted tariff as he is a serving prisoner. [09] The Respondent did not file any submissions and left the matter be decided by the court. [10] I agree with the Appellant that the sentence passed in File No: 1605/07 is excessive. Therefore I quash the 7 years imprisonment sentence. Now I proceed to impose an appropriate sentence in File No: 1605/07. [11] After considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances, I impose 03 years imprisonment concurrent to sentences imposed in File Nos:1602/07,1603/07 and 1604/07. [12] I further order this sentence of 03 years imprisonment be run concurrent to his present serving term of imprisonment effective from 29/01/2013. [13] Appellant has 30 days to appeal.
