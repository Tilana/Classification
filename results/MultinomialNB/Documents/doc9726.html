This is an application by the applicant for orders seeking the respondent to pay children's maintenance and Spousal Maintenance (Form 5). The children's' name are Miss A and Master P. The first child was born on 13th April 2004 and second was born on 20th February 2008. Parties are legally married to each other. Marriage was dissolved on 08th March 2011 by Deputy Registrar. 2. The Respondent was duly served Form 5. Meantime interim order was made that the Respondent to pay $50 per child fortnightly. Altogether $100. Then the Respondent filed the form 6 asking cancelation of interim order seeking full hearing of pertinent applications. The Respondent further to form 6, he filed form 9 asking full custody of the children. Meantime, the Applicant has filed form 7 contempt paper against the Respondent. On 11th August 2011, the Applicant filed form 12 along with supporting affidavit and sought absconding warrant against the Respondent. The Court has issued absconding warrant and it is still prevail. 3. The matter was heard on 22nd September 2011. On hearing date the Respondent was absent and unrepresented. Court notes earlier he was represented by Mr. Daveta. 4. At the hearing, The Applicant said they were legally married. The marriage certificate tendered as EX-1 to prove this fact. By this marriage she got two children. The first one is 7 year old and second child is 3 years old now. They lived together till August 2007. Then the Respondent went to England to join the British Army. They separated in 2007. But the Respondent continued to support them. The respondent sent money to the Applicant's ANZ bank account monthly. The Birth Certificates tendered as Ex-2 and this bank statement tendered as Ex-3. The Applicant said the Respondent married again and she stayed at the Respondent's parent's house. She has nowhere to go. . Her first Daughter is a heart patient and she underwent a heart surgery. Therefore she needs special care and treatments. She adduced evidence at length on her expenditures on children. CWM Hospital letter was tendered as EX-4. This proves her eldest child underwent heart surgery on 20-05-2005 and she is on yearly review. Medical prescriptions were tendered as Ex-5. School bills were tendered as Ex-6. Head teacher's letter was tendered as Ex-7. Altogether she asked $200 per week as children and spousal maintenance. The Applicant said the Respondent earns more than 2000 GB pounds per month. She said they have bought a property in England. The Respondent has capacity to earn and ask maintenance for them. 5. Thereafter the Applicant closed her case. 6. The parents have primary duty to maintain this child. I now draw my attention to the Section 86 of the Family Law Act 2003. 86.- (1) The parents of a child have, subject to this Division, the primary duty to maintain the child. (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the duty of a parent to maintain a child- (a) is not of lower priority than the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person; (b) has priority over all commitments of the parent other than commitments necessary to enable the parent to support- (i) himself or herself; or (ii) any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain; and (c) is not affected by the duty of any other person to maintain the child. (Underlining is mine) 7. Thus, law is very clear fathers are equally liable to maintain their children born within the wedlock. 8. Section 155 of said Act stipulates awarding of spousal maintenance. I reproduce this section for clarity. 155. A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party if reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately, whether- (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years; (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment; or (c) for any other adequate reason 9. The Respondent has divorced the Applicant. Can she still claim spousal maintenance? 165.-(1) An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage ceases to have effect- (a) upon the death of the party; (b) upon the death of the person liable to make payments under the order. (2) An order with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage ceases to have effect upon the re-marriage of the party or the party cohabitating with another person in a domestic relationship unless in special circumstances a court which has jurisdiction under this Act otherwise orders. (Underlining is mine) (3) Where a re-marriage or the cohabitation referred to in subsection (2) takes place, it is the duty of the person for whose benefit the order was made to inform without delay the person liable to make payments under the order of the date of the re-marriage or cohabitation. (Underlining is mine) (4) Any moneys paid in respect of a period after the event referred to in subsection (2) may be recovered in a court which has jurisdiction under this Act. (5) Nothing in this section affects the recovery of arrears due under an order at the time when the order ceased to have effect. (Underlining is mine) 10. Therefore Family law provides spousal maintenance until the divorcee starts cohabitating with another person in a domestic relationship or re-marries. Apart from death of a party to the relevant order for maintenance if the party in de facto relationship or re marries then spousal maintenance ceases. In this case the Respondent did not say that the Applicant is having de facto relationship somebody or she has re married to somebody. Therefore she is liable to have spousal maintenance under our family law. 11. The next question is quantum of maintenance. The Respondent works in British Army. The Respondent in his form 6 response to this application paragraph 5, Part C categorically admitted he earns FJD 1250 per week. But the Respondent did not adduce any evidence of his expenditures, financial commitments and he evaded the hearing. The applicant has small children and she is incapacitating to earn something at this moment. She asks $200 per week and according to current cost of living I hold this amount is reasonable. Maintenance means day to day living expenses. The Applicant has been waiting to get maintenance and the Respondent is evading the payment of interim maintenance as well. Under the family law paramount consideration is welfare of the children and the Respondent is evading payment of maintenance. At the moment the Respondent is in British Army, This court has no power to give attachment order. If it could be given children can have their meals and welfare conveniently. To enforce this order, The Applicant may ask H.E. the British Ambassador in Fiji to forward thing order to British Army and get attachment order with the consent of the Respondent. Maintenance could be directly deducted from salary and could be deposited to the applicant's bank account monthly (FJD 800). This could be done because Fiji and United Kingdom have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (20 November 1989). Article 3 of the said Convention says; "1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. (Underlining is mine) 2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures. 3. States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision." 12. Therefore, As enforcement is an administrative act, this order could be activated through British Embassy and British Army for the betterment and welfare of the children. 13. Therefore, I hold the Respondent has a legal duty to maintain the children until they attained age of majority or finish their tertiary education. Moreover the Respondent has means to pay and capacity to pay this maintenance. I make following orders; i) The Respondent to pay maintenance at the rate of 200 per week with effect from today as children's' maintenance and spousal maintenance. ii) The Applicant to file Judgment Debtor Summons to recover balance of interim maintenance. iii) If maintenance not paid by the Respondent, JDS to be calculated and in default the Respondent to be imprisoned 10days for every $100(One Penalty Unit). iv) Absconding warrant to be prevailed until cancellation order. v) The Applicant may get assistance of H.E. the British Ambassador of Fiji to enforce this order. Orders Accordingly. SUMUDU PREMACHANDRA RESIDENT MAGISTRATE 20-10--2011 Copies1. The Applicant; 2. File 0116/NAS/2010. 3. The Respondent; the Applicant to serve this order through by post or other mode of delivery and assistance.</p></div></div></body></html>
