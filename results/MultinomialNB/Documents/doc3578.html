HBC0119 OF 2005 BETWEEN: DAVENDRA NAIDU fathers name Subba Naidu of Magruru, Ba, Businessman, SATENDRA NAIDU fathers name Subba Naidu of Lovu, Lautoka, Businessman and MUN SAMY NAIDU of Lovu, Lautoka, Retired. PLAINTIFF AND: JONE SENIROGA aka JOHN SENIROGA C/- Tropic Wood Ltd, Lautoka. Security & Transport Supervisor, TITILIA NASOSOGENGE and MALA all of 13 Kadavu Street, Waiyavi, Lautoka, Nurse and Unemployed respectively. DEFENDANT Mr A. Patel and Ms M Muir for the Plaintiffs Ms C. Punja for the Defendants. Date of Hearing: 18 October 2005 Date of Memorandum: 18 October 2005 MEMORANDUM FOR COUNSEL I heard argument today and reserved my ruling. In the course of argument I noted that Mr Patel who was appearing for the Plaintiffs had left the Court. I raised with Ms Muir the question whether she was entitled to appear alone. I continued with the hearing and this situation will not interfere with the ruling that I will shortly issue. I am however unable to find the authorities which govern the situation covering Ms Muirs appearance and I invite her to file with the Court and serve on Ms Punja a brief statement of the authorities. Argument was heard in Chambers and that may affect the matters. I shall issue the ruling after that has been filed. D.D. Finnigan JUDGE At Lautoka 18 October 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
