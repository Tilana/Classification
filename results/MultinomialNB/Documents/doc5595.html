The Law on stay proceeding is settled In R v Derby Crown Court, exp Brooks [1984] 80 Cr. App. R. 164, Sir Roger Ormrod said: "The power to stop a prosecution arises only when it is an abuse of the process of the court. It may be an abuse of processes if either: (a) the prosecution have manipulated or misused the process of the court so as to deprive the defendant of a protection provided by law or to take unfair advantage of a technicality, or (b) on the balance of probability the defendant has been, or will be, prejudiced in the prosecution of or conduct of his defence by delay on the part of the prosecution which is unjustifiable: for example, not due to the complexity of the inquiry and preparation of the prosecution case, or to the action of the defendant or his co-accused or to genuine difficulty in effecting service". The inherent power to stay criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process has long been recognised in Common Law. But it should only be employed in exceptional circumstances (State v Waisale Rokotuiwai HAC 009 of 1995). In the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Jackaran Tokai and others (Trinidad and Tobago) [1996] (12th June 1996) Privy Council Appeal No.53 of 1995 (Judgment delivered on 12th June, 1996). Their Lordships said: "However, we remind ourselves of the principles outlined earlier in this judgment and the observation of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] A.C.1254,1304, that: 'generally speaking a prosecutor has as much right as a defendant to demand a verdict of a jury on an outstanding indictment, and where either demands a verdict a judge has no jurisdiction to stand in the way of it'. Stays imposed on the grounds of delay or for any other reason should only be employed in exceptional circumstances. If they were to become a matter of routine, it would be only a short time before the public, understandably, viewed the process with suspicion and mistrust. We respectfully adopt the reasoning of Brennan J. in Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 C.L.R. 23. In principle, therefore, even where the delay can be said to be unjustifiable, the imposition of a Permanent Stay should be the exception rather than the rule. Still more rare should be cases where a stay can properly be imposed in the absence of any fault on the part of the complainant or prosecution. Delay due merely to the complexity of the case or contributed to by the actions of the defendant himself should never be the foundation for a stay. In answer to the second question posed by the Attorney-General, no stay should be imposed unless the defendant shows on the balance of probabilities that owing to the delay he will suffer serious prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held: in other words, that the continuance of the prosecution amounts to a misuse of the process of the court. In assessing whether there is likely to be prejudice and if so whether it can properly be described as serious, the following matters should be borne in mind: first, the power of the judge at common law and under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to regulate the admissibility of evidence; secondly, the trial process itself, which should ensure that all relevant factual issues arising from delay will be placed before the jury as part of the evidence for their consideration, together with the powers of the judge to give appropriate directions to the jury before they consider their verdict." [7] When peruse the chronology of events in this case, it is noted that most delays were caused by one or the other of the accused persons not attending court on numbers of days where bench warrant was issued on them. [8] Applicant has failed to show that the prosecution has manipulated or misused the powers of Court so as to deprive the applicant of a protection provided by law or to take unfair advantage of a technicality. [9] Although the applicant says that his main witness, his mother passed away, he has not mentioned what her evidence was going to be and how would it cause prejudice in his defense. [10] The Magistrate would ensure that he would give careful consideration to all the relevant factual issues arising from the delay when considering the evidence. [11] I find that no prejudice would cause to the applicant due to the delay caused already, and that the applicant can be tried fairly. [12] However considering the delay I direct the Magistrate to hear and determine this case expeditiously. [13] Application for permanent stay is refused. Dated at Suva this 23rd day of August 2011.
