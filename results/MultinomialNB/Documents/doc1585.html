KALIVATI BAKANI 2. KENI DAKUIDREKETI ACCUSED PERSONS Counsel: Mr. Blanchflower M, Ms. Yang E. and Ms. Puleiwai F for FICAC Mr. Keene B QC, Ms. Cole Mand Mr. Clarke W for the Accused Dates of Hearing: 23rd June 2014 28th July 2014 Date of Summing Up: 1st August 2014 SUMMING UP I. ROLE OF THE JUDGE AND ASSESSORS 1. Madam Assessor and Gentlemen Assessors, You would recall that this trial formally commenced in your presence on 25th June 2014. You have been witnessing the evidence, both oral and documentary, placed before you by the prosecution and defence along with their closing addresses for the last 5 weeks. It won't make you surprised if I say that the prosecution has tendered 270 documents, whilst defence submitted 37 documents in support of their respective arguments. The tape recorded court proceedings run into over 1049 type written pages. This background will no doubt demonstrate the exact parameters of the task that you are entrusted with. As I have already indicated to you, after my Summing Up, you will be asked to retire for your deliberations. Hence, at this last stage, I invite you panel of assessors, to extend the same co-operation and attentiveness you showed throughout this lengthy trial. 2. First and foremost, I would like to emphasis, Madam Assessor and Gentlemen assessors that you were chosen to be the judges of facts in this trial, as already indicated to you by the learned counsel, because you represent a live cross section of the pulse of this society. Your common sense and the experience in day to day life must come into operation when you deliberate this case. The common sense and the life experiences have to be utilized in deciding or assessing the truthfulness or honesty of witnesses and their credibility. In that task, you have the liberty to accept the whole version of a testimony of a witness or a portion of that testimony and reject the rest. Moreover, you can even refuse to accept the whole testimony of a witness. 3. You have to decide the credibility and truthfulness of each and every witness. In doing so, you can rely on not only what you heard, but what you saw as well. The way witnesses offered evidence from the witness box, how they faced the cross examination, were they firm on their stand or evasive, can be helpful in determining their demeanour and in turn to judge their credibility as well. In furtherance to assessing the trustworthiness of the witnesses, in this instance, you have to pay a considerable amount of attention to the set of documents tendered to court by the prosecution. This is a case basically depended on such documents.Apart from assessing the truthfulness and the credibility of the witnesses, you are supposed to follow the same procedure in respect of the documents as well. 4. The other most important factor is, when deliberating the matter before hand, you have to rely only on the evidence tendered in court, either oral or documentary, and nothing else. It is a fact that this trial attracted a considerable amount of media attention. You may have read or seen something regarding this case in media or elsewhere before or during the trial. You should simply disregard what you saw or heard from the printed or electronic media regarding this case or any related incidents alleged to have taken place in NLTB or VDCL or PCX before the trial. Any views or opinions expressed by your friends, family members, relatives or anybody, is not evidence. You, Madam Assessor and Gentlemen assessors, have to draw your own conclusions based on the evidence presented in court. It is your duty to apply the law and the legal principles, which I am going to explain to you in a short while, in respect of the evidence you have heard and saw within the four corners of this court house. 5. Let us now identify more precisely our roles to be performed at this last stage. You had the privilege of hearing all the evidence led in this trial. You have heard both the Learned Prosecutor and the Learned Defence Counsel making their closing addresses. The final step before you retire for your deliberations is the Summing Up from me. In my Summing Up, I will direct you on matters of Law, which you must accept as correct and act upon it. You must apply the law as I direct you, as throughout the trial, "the law" has been my area of responsibility. 6. In as much as I am entrusted with the responsibility of the area of "Law", Madam assessor and Gentleman assessors, you hold the responsibility of the "facts". That is how you become the Judges or masters of the facts. It is you who should decide whose evidence is to be relied upon, what evidence is to be accepted, what weight is to put on a particular piece of evidence, etc. 7. Therefore, if I express any particular view or opinion or if I appear to do so about the facts of this case in my summing up it is solely a matter for you to decide whether or not to accept what I say. You can either agree with my contention or ignore the same and formulate your own opinions. In the same vein, Counsel for the Prosecution and Defence have already addressed you on the facts, but once again, you need not adopt their views of the facts, unless you do agree with their contention and analysis. The Counsel have a right to make such comments when performing their roles and duties. If you strongly think that those comments and analysis do appeal to your common sense and judgment, you are free to use them as you see fit. But, when I direct you on the Law and legal principles, you have to accept that as true and accurate and should act upon that. In the same vein, I might overlook or omit certain evidence, which in your analysis, is important. You can formulate your own opinions by giving due consideration to any piece of evidence as you think necessary. 8. You will be given the opportunity to retire for your deliberations after my Summing Up. Once, each of you, madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, reach to a conclusion on your final opinion, the court will re-convene and your individual opinions will be asked. You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions at any time. The opinions of you five need not to be unanimous, but of course, it would be desirable if you could agree on the final opinion. As the presiding judge of this case I am not bound by your opinions in delivering the final judgment of the court. Nevertheless, I assure you that due weight and recognition will be given to your opinions when I deliver the final judgment. 9. Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, please recall the oath administered when you assumed duties as assessors; your true opinion to be given without any fear or favour or ill will in accordance with the evidence and the law. You are not supposed to be passionate towards anybody or any party. The prosecution says that millions of monies, which could have been used for the betterment of the native Fijians, were wasted. On the other hand, defence says that the accused is facing the loss of his liberty. You are not supposed to be carried away by any of these propositions. You need not to bother about the final outcome of the case. It is a concern of the court. The duty of you madam assessor and gentlemen assessors is to base your opinion on the evidence presented in court and nothing else. Please don't speculate or presume anything apart from the evidence what you saw and heard during the trial. II. THE BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF 1. When approaching the matter in hand, I would like to draw your attention madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, to certain basic rules which govern our criminal justice system. The accused is presumed to be innocent, though he is charged before this court with five counts of 'Abuse of Office', until he is found guilty by this court. Proving his guilt is the sole burden of the prosecution, as it was the prosecution, who accuses the accused of committing the said offences of "Abuse of Office". The duty of the prosecution to prove the case against the accused continues throughout the trial and it never shifts to the accused. The law does not impose any obligation or duty upon the accused to prove his innocence or otherwise. 2. When proving the case against the accused, the law expects the prosecution to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. That means the prosecution must prove the case for you to be 'sure' of the guilt of the accused and nothing else will discharge their burden. There is no specific formula where you can have a mathematical precision to be 'sure'. It is all about your day to day experiences and common sense come into play once again. The ultimatum is that you, madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, must be 'sure' of the guilt of the accused based on the presented evidence in court by the prosecution. If you have a 'reasonable doubt' over the guilt of the accused that benefit should immediately be awarded to the accused. Such a doubt, as stated, should definitely be a 'reasonable doubt'. A mere possible doubt or trivial and imaginary doubts will not create a reasonable doubt. It should be an actual or substantial doubt which shakes the foundation of the case of the prosecution. The doubts should stem out of the evidence what you saw and heard in court. 3. Before proceeding any further, I must remind you, though already directed you in my 'Opening Instructions', you have to look at each Count or Charge on the Information separately. There are five (5) separate charges of 'Abuse of Office' laid down against Mr. Keni Dakuidreketi (hereinafter referred as Mr. KD), the accused. Prosecution is expected to prove all five (5) beyond reasonable doubt or to your fullest satisfaction. That is to say that the prosecution has to produce evidence pertaining to all the charges separately and you have to assess the said evidence separately for each charge. Thus, it is practically possible for you to reach different opinions on different charges. In other words, if you find the accused guilty/not guilty for one charge does not necessarily mean that he is guilty/not guilty of other charges as well. 4. You are aware by now that at the end of the case of the prosecution, court decided to call for the defence and the accused opted to remain silent and not to offer any evidence on his behalf. That is his right. He is entitled to remain silent and say that the prosecution have not proved their case against him to the required standard. You must not assume he is guilty because he has not given evidence. Still the prosecution must have to prove for you to be sure that he is guilty of these crimes as charged. You know that you are trying this case according to the available evidence. However you will have to appreciate that the accused has not given evidence at this trial to undermine, contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution. Matters put to the prosecution witnesses in cross examination by the defence are not evidence until the witness agrees to those matters. You would recall, the learned defence counsel in his closing address to you (para 9.7 9.12) said that Mr. KD did not see him as a civil servant and much more likely reasons motivated him as a part of VDCL in dealings with PCX. Those are the 'propositions'of the counsel and not evidence. You have to base your opinions on evidence. 5. The evidence presented to you during the course of the trial, both oral and documentary, can be either direct or circumstantial evidence. The existence of Articles of Association or Memorandum of Articles of VDCL was produced with direct documentary evidence. When Mr. Boila and Mr. Saukawa said that they held the post of VDCL Board Secretary that is direct oral evidence. 6. There is some evidence in this case that could be referred to as "circumstantial evidence". That simply means the prosecution is relying upon evidence of various circumstances relating to the crime and the accused, which they say when taken together will lead to the sure conclusion that he committed these offences. Circumstantial evidence can be powerful evidence, indeed, it can be as powerful as, or even more powerful than, direct evidence, but it is important that you examine it with care as with all evidence and consider whether the evidence on which the prosecution relies in proof of its case is reliable and whether it does prove guilt or whether on the other hand it reveals any other circumstances which are or may be of sufficient reliability and strength to cast upon or destroy the prosecution case. Finally you should be careful to distinguish between arriving at conclusions based on reliable circumstantial evidence and mere speculation. Speculating in a case amounts to no more than guessing or making up theories without good evidence to support them and neither the prosecution, the defence, nor you should do that. 7. The other important matter I want to make it clear is the appearance of Mr. Kalivati Bakani's name in the Information. You see that there are ten (10) charges reflectin the Information, five (5) against Mr. Bakani (odd numbers) and the other five (5) against Mr. KD (even numbers). Mr. Blanchflower, SC, in his opening address, told you that the prosecution is concentrating only on even numbered charges against Mr. KD. It was already published in media and you might or might not be aware that Mr. Bakani pleaded guilty to all the charges against him. This, you might have heard by now and I doubt that it could be a secret any more. At the same time, throughout this trial, Mr. Bakani's name was mentioned by almost every witness referring to various documents. The sole reason for me to mention you about Mr. Bakani's plea of guilt is to remove any question, doubt or speculation, if anything is left, in your minds as to why you are not trying him along with Mr. KD. Mr. Bakani's plea of guilt should not have any bearing on your decision in this case against Mr. KD. It is still the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against Mr. KD for you to be sure of his guilt, just as it would have to if Mr. Bakani had not pleaded guilty. III. THE INFORMATION 1.

V THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES Prosecution Witness #1 Mr. Ratu Cokanauto Tu'uakitau 1. The first witness of the prosecution was Mr. Cokanauto Tu'uakitau. He was a member of the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) and the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) from 1999 to 2006. He said that the Native Land Trust Board was established under the Native Land Trust Act. He was the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NLTB and the Review Committee of the Great Council of Chiefs. According to Mr. Tu'uakitau, the purpose of the NLTB, when it was formulated, was to administer for on behalf of all the native lands of Fijian land owners. He referred to these lands in Fijian as 'Qele Maroroi'. On behalf of the said land owners, NLTB administer the lands and collects the rents. Those funds are been held by the NLTB on trust for the landowners. Witness identified Mr. KD as a member of the Board of Directors of NLTB during the period of year 2001 2007. Mr. Kalivati Bakani had been the General Manager of NLTB from year 2003 2007. 2. Mr. Tu'uakitau described the process of a Board Meeting to court. Before a particular Board Meeting, the "Agenda" and the "Board Papers" would be circulated to the Board members. "Board Papers" would show the "items" or the topics scheduled to be discussed at the meeting. The "minutes" of the Board meeting would be kept by the Board Secretary with the assistance of his hand written notes and a tape recorder. Further, it would show at the very beginning the members who were present and absent. The said 'minutes', which contain the discussions of the Board members during the meeting, will be circulated by the Secretary before the next meeting, enabling the Board members to correct or amend those minutes whilst matters are still clear and fresh in mind, before the same is been ratified and signed by the Chairman. Witness went on to say that it is customary for the General Manager to make a Report to the Board and that would also be recorded in these minutes. Finally, on this issue, the witness said that the Board relies on the accuracy of the "minutes" and thus, part and parcel of NLTB. 3. Referring to the Standing Committee, of which Mr. Tu'uakitau was the Chairman, the witness said that whenever matters arose that the Board could not deal with or make a decision on a particular meeting, those were referred to the Standing Committee to look further into it and put recommendations to the Board. He confirmed Mr. KD; the accused was also a member of the Standing Committee for the period of year 2004 2007. The "minuting process" of the Board had been followed in the meetings of the Standing Committee as well. 4. Mr. Tu'uakitau referred to Exhibit No. 10. That is NLTB Board Paper NO: 30/2003 on "INVESTMENT (LENDING/BORROWING) OF TRUST FUNDS POLICY PAPER". Paragraph 2.1 (Background) of this says that: "The Board does maintain excess funds in its trust accounts that are unpaid and uncollected at any given period. There are some invested funds that derive interest as shown hereunder from the 2002 Annual Report." Witness explained "Native Owners equity" in 2.11 of the table as "the funds held in trust by the Board in its trust fund" and "Investments (held in Trust for native owners" in 2.14 as "investments made for an on behalf of native owners by the NLTB, would that be shareholding or otherwise and would be held by Board." He explained "Extinct Mataqali Funds" in paragraph 2.4 as "&mataqali's or landowners in which there is no living person to receive that money on behalf of that mataqali and those funds would be held by the Board." 5. This witness referred to paragraph 2.6 of Exhibit 10. "The Board has also approved for the establishment of its commercial vehicle, Vanua Development Corporation Ltd [VDCL] to spearhead investment opportunities that would create more wealth in return for the financial viability of the Board leading to the possible reduction of the current 15% poundage." He said the purpose of Vanua Development Corporation Limited was to look for investment opportunities for the utilization of investment funds to create an income stream back to the Board as it in return the flow of benefits would go to the native land owners. 6. Exhibit No. 11 Board Paper No. 31/2003 of NLTB in relation to the establishment of VDCL was endorsed by Mr. Tu'uakitau. "The main objective of VDC is to invest the funds it receives from NLTB to generate additional revenue for the Board. Additional revenue is needed to, among other things, finance initiatives the Board wants to undertake for the benefit of landowners. They may include a reduction in poundage to increase distributable funds to landowners. Also if well-endowed financially NLTB can enjoy greater autonomy in its operation. Another objective of VDC is to properly manage landowners' investments in the Trust Fund. Between $9-12m is usually in the Trust Fund at any time. If managed professionally, earnings on this Fund can increase." The funds that VDCL was going to receive, according to this witness, included both 'Trust Funds' and 'Extinct Mataqali Funds'. He highlighted one of VDCL's expectations as the reduction in "poundage" to increase the distributable funds to the native land owners. 7. Paragraph 3 refers to the "Investments Fund" of VDCL. Paragraph 7 says that "As at 30 November 2003, the total investment portfolio of the Trust Fund was $6,957, 468. Coupled with a cash balance of $3 million, total funds in the 'Trust Fund is $9,957, 468. The investment is broken down as follows: Native Owners Investments - $3,517,066 Other investments and General Term Deposits - $3,440,402" This $3,440,402 is been acquired with the lease monies from 'schedule A' lands. Mr. Tu'uakitau said that 'Schedule A' lands means 'Extinct Mataqali Lands' and so refers to 'Extinct Mataqali Funds' (EMF). He confirmed the 2nd portion of paragraph 7 that these 'funds' are being held in 'transition' before going to the Central Fijian Treasury and therefore, if it is to be transferred to VDCL, the approval of the Fijian Affairs Board (FAB) is needed." 8. Finally, on Exhibit No. 11, witness referred to paragraph 11, the following recommendations among others in place. "The Board is invited to approve the following recommendations: 1. Progress the establishment Vanua Development Corporation Ltd so that it is operational by 1 January 2004. 2. The principal activities of VDC shall be investment, and investment management of the Trust Fund. 3. Authorized capital to be $20m and the paid up capital to be $7.7m comprising: 4. That the following persons be appointed to the Board and the directors' fee shall be $10,000 chairman and $6,000 for Directors. Similar conditions currently applicable to NLTB Board members should also apply. Chairman: Keni Dakuidreketi (NLTB Board) Director: Nalin Patel (G Lal & Company) Director: Daniel Whippy (Carpenters Fiji Ltd) Director: Isoa Kaloumaira (Fijian Trust Fund) Director: Kalivati Bakani (NLTB)" 9. Mr. Tu'uakitau confirmed the existence of a 'Common Seal' in NLTB. He said that for its use or for sealing, a Board resolution is required. He was not sure whether a member can use the said seal or it is something to do with the Chairman. The witness stressed that the Directors of VDCL have to come back to NLTB to vet all the investments and contracts and get the approval to the same as the Board vested the authority of the 'Trustee'. 10. Then Mr. Tu'uakitau referred to Exhibit No. 9. It is the 'Minutes of 363rd Meeting of NLTB held on 18th of December 2003. Paragraph 6 of the same says that Mr. Bakani, the General Manager led the discussion. Paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 were on Deliberations and Resolutions of the Board. The attention of the witness was drawn to the following portions; "6.2.5. Management to submit another paper detailing Authorised Trustee Investments. Further, all investment of Trust Funds must come to the Board because the Board is Trustee and cannot delegate that responsibility. 6.2.9Chairman clarified that recommendation 6.3 will have taken careof the point raised by Member Sadole and has been confirmed by DGM (O). Recommendation 6.1 to be amended slightly to the effect "The Board notes and based on legal advice the Board is able to onlend Trust Funds. And that this authority to be able to onlend Trust funds shall only be exercised by the Board." 6.3(iii) that Management to formulate investment procedures and the appropriate regulations with the Ministry of Fijian Affairs." 11. Paragraph 7.0 related to VDCL Board paper No: 31/2003, which you saw as Exhibit No. 11. Finally, paragraph 7.10 reflects that the NLTB resolved that VDCL to commence its operations by 5th of January 2004 with the above mentioned Board of Directors with an authorized capital of $20 million and paid up capital of $7.7 million with the objective of investment and investment management of the Trust Fund. It was told by Mr. Tu'uakitau that Mr. Nalin Patel, Mr. Daniel Whippy and Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira, who were appointed to the VDCL Board of Directors, were not members of the NLTB. He confirmed that Mr. KD, the accused was appointed as the Chairman of VDCL by the NLTB and Mr. KD was expected to inform and recommend NLTB about the investment opportunities for vetting and approval of the same. He stressed that NLTB being the trustee of the funds, it was only the full Board of NLTB could approve the investments of such funds. 12. Pointing to the periods of year 2004, 2005 and 2006, Mr. Tu'uakitau said that Mr. KD, the accused did not make such reports of the investments of VDCL to NLTB. Had such a report been made, according to the witness, it would normally be recorded in Board minutes of NLTB along with the related discussions and resolutions. 13. This witness then referred to Exhibit No. 29, the NLTB Board Papers scheduled for 26th February 2004 and specifically spoke about Board Paper 004/2004, "Trust Funds Investment Paper" (page 91). He said the purpose of this paper was to provide a direction to NLTB's investment arm, the VDCL, what to be adhered to and followed when utilizing the funds. 14. NLTB Board Paper 005/2004 (page 99) is on "Evaluation of Solutions for the IT Roadmap". Witness said that there was a need for a new computer system as the existed system was not compatible and been outdated. The recommendation in paragraph 11 (i) is to engage the services of Tui Consulting to install MySAP, IXOS and ESRI as the preferred solution for the required specifications. 15. Then this witness's attention was drawn to Information Paper No: 001/2004. (page 116) It was meant to inform the NLTB members about the latest developments in respect of VDCL. Witness agreed that one business proposal which received to VDCL was to have 51% of shareholding from IT Company called PacificConnex Ltd, which involves in IT related work, both locally and overseas. 16. Exhibit No. 31, NLTB Board minutes dated 12th March 2004, was next shown to Mr. Tu'uakitau. This was an extra ordinary meeting to have a presentation of one Mr. Ballu Khan of Tui Consulting on his SAP Solution for the NLTB's IT "Road Map". It is in this meeting Mr. Bakani, being the General Manager, had informed the NLTB members that VDCL will be owned 51% of shares of PCX, which in turn will benefit NLTB. After a Power Point Presentation about the proposed IT system, the NLTB members had resolved to engage the services of PCX to install the proposed IT Solution. Nevertheless, the witness said that certain members of NLTB raised their concerns about the 'cash factor' of this IT solution, as it was informed that SAP project cost would be $4.6 million. (Paragraph 5.7). Further, it was confirmed by the witness the queries of the members on "who owns what out of the project". Mr. Ballu Khan's response to that is in paragraph 5.8. "Member Buresova queried as to who owns what out of the project. " Mr. Ballu Khan in response explained that the up-front cost would be borne by Pacific Connex that is to implement the solution for NLTB. PacificConnex would only get paid once the Solution is implemented. " The terms and conditions of the contract between NLTB and Pacific Connex would be such that if Pacific Connex does not perform then NLTB gets redress. " The $4.6 million is borne up front by Pacific Connex who in turn will recoup the amount over a period of time. Such deals are normally of 8 year terms, it is 11 years in this case." 17. Further to that Mr. Khan had made a presentation to the members and told "TUI Consulting was formed in 1997. The challenge then was to find something unique. TUI is a traditional name in New Zealand. It means Chief and signifies Leadership in Fiji. TUI consulting has no debt; always operated on its own cash flows. TUI Consulting is not a shareholder in Pacific Connex. Mr. Ballu Khan and Strategic Change Manager Mojito Mua left the meeting, after their presentation, as this stage." 18. Mr. Tu'uakitau said that the Board members wanted to know who were the shareholders of PCX over and above the 51% shares of VDCL as Mr. Khan told them that TUI Consulting is not a shareholder in PCX. But, he said that to date, he is not aware anything about the other shareholders who owned 49% as Mr. Khan or anybody else did not disclose that. And, the financial history of PCX, though requested by the NLTB, had not been provided to them either by Mr. Khan or Mr. Bakani or Mr. KD. Finally, Mr. Tu'uakitau said that had NLTB was aware of any financial problems of PCX during 2004, 2005 and 2006, it would be a matter of concern and should have been made aware of by Mr. KD and Mr. Bakani as they were a Director and the Managing Director of NLTB and held dual responsibility with their duties in VDCL as Chairman and a Director respectively. If such financial problems or difficulties of PCX have been made known to NLTB Board, he said those should have been recorded in the 'minutes' and members would have deliberated upon those issues. 19. Then Mr. Keene, QC, started the cross examination of Mr. Tu'uakitau. First, Mr. Tu'uakitau agreed that whenever the Board Papers or Board Meetings refer to "Management" that does not include the Board members. He said the 'poundage' or the amount charged by the NLTB to administer the lands of the native landowners was brought down to 25% to 15%. Referring to "Summary of Legal Opinions" in paragraph 3 of Exhibit 10, the witness said that the issues of responsibilities and powers, where the legal opinions sought were in respect of NLTB and that is not of VDCL. Mr. Keene, QC, pointed to paragraph 6.2.1, 6.2.5 and 6.2.9 of Exhibit 10 by stressing the usage of "Trust Funds" of the NLTB in those portions. In the 3rd bullet point of paragraph 7.2, "The Structure of the Corporation and its equity structure", the witness agreed that the 'word' 'corporation refers to 'VDCL'. 20. The term 'Special Fund' of $1,569,208 in paragraph 6 of Exhibit 11 (CURRENT NLTB INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO) explained by the witness as the fund which had been channeled from the 'Trust Fund' to NLTB with the approval of the Board and Great Council of Chiefs with the specific purpose of those funds been utilized or invested for the benefit of the Fijians. Witness agreed with the learned counsel that the NLTB investments or finance have restrictions for lending because they are Board funds and taking steps to spend those funds is not in breach of any trust. He said that the "paid up equity" or the 'share capital' of VDCL was proposed to be $7.7 million and "Transfer of investments in Trust Fund derived from income from Schedule A & B Land" in paragraph 8 (shareholding structure & capital) of $3,440, 402 means "Trust money". He confirmed this paid up equity of $7.7 million to VDCL was comprised of three different types of "money"; Government money, NLTB's own money and Trust money. Explaining the "authorized capital" of VDCL be $20 million, the witness said that with the opening capital of $7.7 million, the company had to create the balance capital with other investments. 21. Mr. Tu'uakitau confirmed that the five Directors (05) of VDCL, including one of NLTB's Directors (Mr.KD) and its General Manager, were appointed by the NLTB Board. Talking about Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira, an appointed Director to VDCL, the witness agreed that he was selected because of his background in banking and finance as VDCL was meant to be more entrepreneurial than NLTB. He went on to say that when he agreed with the recommendations and the Board Paper to establish VDCL it was done after reading the same and as in the case of other members, he also thought that VDCL will be another vehicle for Fijian investments. 22. Mr. Keene, QC referred to paragraph 11.4 of the Recommendations in Exhibit 11. It says: "FAB to be requested to approve the transfer of funds in the Trust Fund which belongs to it as equity in VDC.Moreover that they be approached for a grant or interest free loan of $1m as additional equity for VDC." Mr. Tu'uakitau said that "Trust funds" means the 'Extinct Mataqali Funds'. He elaborated that Extinct Mataqali Funds arise when there is no Mataqali in existence to claim the money which accumulates over a period of time. The procedure of releasing funds by NLTB is included a paper advertisement to make sure that no direct claimant to the said money misses out. Then only the said funds go to FAB. Therefore, the witness said that the above recommendation was to request from FAB that NLTB's desire of using that money to pay up the share capital of VDCL. Nevertheless, according to the defence exhibit, KD.1, paragraph 2 of page 85 (NLTB, Extinct Mataqali Funds, [Board Paper No. 016/2006], June 2006), the relevant FAB consent had not been obtained and it was recommended that NLTB retain that 3.36 million Extinct Mataqali Funds to be invested in VDCL as equity. In item 11 of Exhibit 202, Minutes of 378th NLTB meeting dated 22nd June 2006, the Board had resolved this recommendation of Mr. Bakani, the General Manager. Further, referring to pages 98 and 104 of Exhibit 142, witness said that it was further intended to request for 1 million interest free loan from FAB as additional equity for VDCL. 23. Then the learned counsel cited the following paragraphs from several Exhibits to say that NLTB had been updated or informed about the affairs of VDCL and PCX, even though this witness claimed negatively. (i) Exhibit 42 NLTB Board Meeting Minutes dated 6th May 2004. - Vanua Development Corporation & PacificConnex Ltd. funding from Government still to be received.

The stand was taken on the following grounds: " That the tender process was not completely transparent and proper procedures were not followed. It was also apparent that the process was loaded against PCX from the beginning. " The terms of the Social Justice Act were not complied with in consideration of the tender. PCX as a 51% owned indigenous company should have received consideration under the terms of the Social Justice Act. The case is to be heard on 14/12/04.

NLTB Board to avoid any conflict of interest in this subject area. His request regarding PCX was resolved by the Board. 24. In answering to Mr. Keene, QC, the witness once said that when the Board refers to 'Management', it means Mr. Bakani and his team. Whilst referring again to paragraph 21.4, Deliberations of Exhibit No. 133, witness admitted that there was no objection recorded from the NLTB about guaranteeing the payments in respect of computer implementation contract of PCX. Later the witness agreed that had PCX achieved a 3G license that would have been a big business for them. 25. Finally, Mr. Tu'uakitau agreed that the fifteen (15) instances he was cited by Mr. Keene, QC, there had been a report on VDCL and PCX in 13 times and the frequency of reporting and its contents and details were greater than he recalled during his evidence in chief. Referring to Exhibit 28, NLTB Standing Committee Meeting Minutes dated 19th February 2004; the witness said that its members resolved to enforce the Management's recommendation that Tui Consulting's presentation in relation to NLTB's IT Road Map be accepted and advice the NLTB main Board accordingly. 26. In re-examination, Mr. Tu'uakitau again explained the 'term' "Trust Fund" whilst focusing on Exhibit 11 paragraphs 2, 6 that a "Special Fund" of $1, 509,208 was created in 1999 with the funds transferred from the 'Trust Funds' after it was approved by the Board and the Great Council of Chiefs (Bose Levu Vakaturaga BLV) as the 'Special Fund' was still meant to be used for the benefit of all Fijians. 27. Pointing to first (1st) entry of FHL "A" class shares in Table 2 of paragraph 6 of Exhibit 11, the witness said that it is the first bullet point of item 2 in paragraph 8 as NLTB resolved to transfer those FHL shares to VDCL. The "Other Investments & General Term Deposits" ($3,440,402) in paragraph 7, the witness said is been reflected in the last figure of paragraph 8 as "Transfer of Investment in Trust Fund derived from income from Schedule A & B land", which is Extinct Mataqali Funds (EMF). Mr. Tu'uakitau stressed that NLTB is still the Trustee of the 'Trust Fund' and was accountable to the native landowners and it was the NLTB who owned the VDCL. 28. Clarifying the issues arose pertaining to FAB's approval in Exhibit 132 (page 98 Information Paper 06/2005), the witness said that had the said funds (EMF) been transferred to FAB from NLTB, that would have brought to the Board's attention through the management. But, the witness went on to say that according to Exhibit KD-1, NLTB Board Paper No. 06/2006 on EMF (June 2006), the NLTB Board has not received any response from FAB over this and the NLTB Board had approved the retention of $3.36 million of EMF to invest with its fully owned subsidiary company, VDCL as equity by the FAB. He said that even the EMF been transferred to FAB, it would still use the same for the benefit of the native Fijians. 29. Coming back to the "reporting to NLTB Board" by Mr. KD as the Chairman of VDCL, Mr. Tu'uakitau repeated that the NLTB Board expected him to advice and inform of investments and the details of investments that VDCL were to undertake as Mr. Bakani and Mr. KD had a "dual responsibility" being appointed to VDCL Board from the NLTB Board membership and management. He continued that that 'responsibility' extends to reporting of PCX matters as well as VDCL had 51% of PCX shares. 30. Finally, referring to the fifteen instances (15) pointed out in the cross examination stated in paragraph 24, Mr. Tu'uakitau agreed that in any of those occasions nothing has been mentioned about a request by PCX to VDCL for a 2 million loan (Exhibit 42) or VDCL lending 2 million to PCX (Exhibit48) or request of PCX to VDCL for a loan of $900,000 (Exhibit 67) or a request for 1 million and granting of loan to PCX by Dominion Finance (Exhibit 78) or in general, the financial situation or loans taken out from various banks and financial institutions including VDCL by PCX. The "no mention" list continued with the Government grant of 1 million been put on a Term Deposit with Dominion Finance as a security for PCX loan extension (Exhibit 133), or ANZ approving a temporary Overdraft facility of 1 million to PCX or the transfer of VDCL's 1 million Term Deposit facility with Dominion to ANZ as a security for the said ANZ overdraft facility to PCX or [VDCL's Term Deposit of 1 million with ANZ] or Credit Corporation loan of $500,000 to PCX in July 2005 (Exhibit 156) or PCX defaulting any loans of other institutions or it defaulting the interest payments to VDCL loans, and finally, PCX's failure to repay the Overdraft of 1 million to ANZ. Prosecution Witness #2 Mr. Nemani Buresova 31. Mr. Buresova had been appointed to the NLTB as a Board member by the Fijian Affairs Board (FAB) in December 2001 and been there since 2006. He recalled that during the said period Mr. Laisenia Qarase, a former Prime Minister, was the Chairman and Mr. KD, the accused was a member whilst Mr. Kalivati Bakani being the General Manager of NLTB. He confirmed that his appointment was done by FAB pursuant to Native Land Trust Act. He had received a Letter of Appointment from the Ministry of Fijian Affairs (Exhibit 1) dated 17th December 2001 under the title; MEMBERSHIP: NATIVE LAND TRUST BOARD. 32. Mr. KD and Mr. Asesela Sadole had also been appointed as Board members of NLTB pursuant to section 3 (1) of the Native Land Trust Act by the Fijian Affairs Board by this same letter. The appointments were for a period of three (3) years with effect from 14th December 2001. 33. Whilst confirming the existed procedure of NLTB Board Meetings, recording of minutes and circulation of Board papers and Board minutes described by Mr. Tu'uakitau, this witness tendered Exhibit No. 7 and Exhibit No. 8, the NLTB Board Papers and Board Minutes dated 23rd October 2003. Board Paper No. 25 of 2003 titled "EXTINCT MATAQALI FUNDS" (Exhibit 07, page 67) was elaborated by Mr. Buresova. He said that the accumulated funds on leases over native lands deemed extinct were kept with NLTB Trust Department as "Frozen Funds" (paragraph 2) and the NLTB is obliged to transmit all Extinct Mataqali Funds kept 'frozen' by its Trust Department to FAB only after the Mataqali's extinct is statutorily declared (paragraph 10) [It is this interim period that the NLTB keeps the Extinct Mataqali Funds under its trusteeship] The following paragraph Exhibit 8 was highlighted by the witness in relation to initiation of VDCL. 3.26. "Vanua Development Corporation The Company has been registered with NLTB Executives as initial Directors. A business plan is being prepared and the Chairman will be consulted on the appointment of Directors. Provisions have been made in the 2004 Budget for initial costs that may be incurred for the setting up of the Company." 34. Mr. Buresova pointed to certain important information in Exhibit No. 30, the NLTB Board Minutes dated 25th of February 2004. 8.0 Evaluation of Solutions for the roadmap (BP No. 005.2004) General Manger led the discussion. 8.1 The objective of the paper was to seek the Board's approval; (i) To engage the services of TUI Consulting to install my SAP, IXOS and ESRI as the preferred solution to address NLTB's Requirements Specifications (ii) To outsource NLTB IT functions (iii) The cost of FD$1.8million per annum for 12 years. 8.2 Deliberation " The system being proposed here is probably the best available in Fiji. Members could consider granting their approval in principle whilst final approval is to be subject to provision of all the necessary information as well as further negotiations of costs. " A financial projection for NLTB to be provided incorporating the $1.8m. per annum payment. " Also if there is available a financial projection for Pacific Connex, it is to be provided to this Board to assist Members' in their considerations. " Detail background information of all those behind TUI Consulting to be provided. " Once all these information are available, an extra ordinary meeting can be called. Resolve Members resolved; " To approve the recommendations in principle subject to the following: (i) Management to further negotiate cost of $1.8m a year downward with TUI consulting. (ii) The reasons behind the 12 year period of payment to be clarified. (iii) Once a final costs is agreed to with TUI Consulting, a financial projection for NLTB incorporating that agreed cost to be provided to this Board. (iv) A financial projection for PacificConnex be also made available to this Board. (v) Background information of all those who are behind TUI Consulting inclusive of their CV's, etc. to be provided to this Board. The witness agreed that according to this material, NLTB has to pay $1.8 million per annum to Tui Consulting for over a period of 12 years. According to paragraph 12 of the Minutes, a $1 million interest free loan from the Government to VDCL "is still awaited". 35. Then Mr. Buresova focused to Exhibit 31, the NLTB Extra Ordinary Meeting Minutes dated 12th March 2004. It had been held with the purpose of evaluating solutions for the IT Roadmap and the engagement of Tui Consulting for that task. He said that the Strategic Change Manager Mr. Mua made a presentation to the members and during the deliberation, he queried the basis of the 12 year repayment period (paragraph 5.1) as his concerns were the length of the period, that NLTB have to be paying the $1.8 million annually and if NLTB sticked to this IT system for such a long period, it would not be changing according to the changes of IT systems, usually happens in every 2 -3 years. In general, he said that his concern was about the cost which had to be incurred by the NLTB in upgrading their computer system. Citing paragraph 5.6, the witness agreed that Director Ratu Varani expressed his reservations on the costs for this project. It was informed to the members, according to paragraph 5.7; the SAP project would cost $4.6 million. 36. Mr. Buresova's attention was then drawn to paragraph 5.8, one of the questions he himself posed 'as to who owns what out of this project' during the meeting. It is been reproduced in paragraph 16 of this chapter. The witness said that in the background of that they were not told about the 'set-up of PacificConnex" and the license for MYSAP is purchasing from abroad, he was worried about the 'ownership' of the 'data' generated in the NLTB system. He said that his understanding was that the owner of Tui Consulting was Mr. Ballu Khan as indicated to the Board during this presentation. Mr. Buresova said that Mr. Khan's representation that PCX would bear the upfront cost of $4.6 million had a big influence on the decisions of him and the Board in general. 37. The witness agreed that after the query, Mr. KD, the accused contributed to the discussion and said that one of the biggest problems in NLTB is its existing IT system and he appreciated the proposal and bold step taken by the management to resolve this issue. (paragraph 5.9) What Mr. Ballu Khan said about Tui Consulting and PCX (paragraph 5.11) after that is reproduced in paragraph 17of this chapter. He said that Ballu Khan's assertion that Tui Consulting had no debts and operates on its own cash flow was important in making a decision to approve Tui Consulting. At last, the Board had resolved to engage the service of PCX to install the preferred IT Solutions to cater the NLTB's needs, to outsource NLTB's IT functions and the cost of the MySAP project to be $1.8 million per annum for 12 years. 38. In cross-examination, Mr. Buresova confirmed that he had been in the NLTB as a member since 14th December 2001 to 2007, for two terms, three years in each time. He agreed that the minutes of a previous meeting were available to the Board members along with the agenda papers for the next meeting and the amendments took place after about 3 months. Referring to paragraph 16 of Exhibit No. 9, witness endorsed that the Board resolved to endorse, ratify and adopt the "Sealing Register" from numbers 58451 to 58579, though he was absent on that day. Mr. Buresova could not recall the objectives or the process of members passing a resolution to ratify the "Sealing Registry" even after pointing to paragraph 9 of Exhibit 8, which refers to the ratification of sealing No. 58525 to 58450. 39. Paragraph 3.24 of Exhibit 8 denotes the appointment of Mr. Majito Mua as the Strategic Change Manger for 3 years. Referring to Tab 28, the minutes of NLTB Standing Committee Meeting held on 19th February 2004, Mr. Buresova said that the meeting was meant to evaluate the solutions to NLTB IT Roadmap where any member of the Standing Committee could inquire into more details before going to the full Board. He agreed that he did not raise some of the issues he raised at the NLTB Board Meeting when the Standing Committee met and in fact, joined the Standing Committee resolution to support the engagement of Tui Consulting. In both occasions, NLTB Board Meeting and its Standing Committee Meeting, witness agreed that despite he raised some questions, he voted with all the other members to adopt the recommended solution after considering the material provided. Prosecution Witness # 03 Mr. Emosi Vitilevu Toga 40. Mr. Toga had been appointed the Secretary to the NLTB Board in July 2002 till October 2004, pursuant to the Native Land Trust Act.

Mr. Toga said the NLTB Board was established under the Native Land Trust Act and the members were appointed under the same Act. He identified Mr. KD, the accused as a member of NLTB Board during his tenure, from July 2002 October 2004. He said that the NLTB Common Seal was kept in Board Secretary's office and during his time it was kept with him. When NLTB signs a contract binding on the Board, the Common Seal needs to be affixed and the approval of the Board is required before the use of the seal. Witness said that at least one Board member has to signify the affix of the seal in his presence with his signature. If NLTB guarantees a loan for a 3rd party, the witness said that the Common Seal needs to be affixed. He confirmed that Mr. Bakani was the General Manager of the Board when he was the Board Secretary and he can identify the two distinctive signatures of Mr. KD and Mr. Bakani. The dates for the meetings, Mr. Toga said, are been fixed by the General Manager in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and it is normally a quarterly basis, but that period could be more shortened or lengthened. According to Mr. Toga, the 'Agenda' for a meeting is prepared by the General Manager with the Board Papers provided to him by respective Managers in various sections and those be circulated to the members along with the minutes of the previous meeting and the General Manager's Report at least 1 week before the meeting. With this arrangement, witness said that the members can make any corrections or amendments to the provided draft meeting minutes after bringing into the attention of the Board and then, first thing in a meeting is to approve the previous meeting minutes with the Chairman's signature. He said that he cannot recall Mr. KD asking to amend or include something he said or someone else told at a meeting. The witness had taken down minutes in "note form" with a backup tape recorder to ensure the accuracy. 42. Mr. Toga confirmed that he took the meeting minutes of Exhibit No. 8 and Exhibit No. 9, NLTB Board Meetings held on 23rd October 2003 and 18th December 2003 respectively. The 3rd document he produced was Exhibit No. 12, NLTB letter dated 23rd December 2003, signed by him to Mr. KD. It is to say that Mr. KD is appointed as the Chairman of VDCL by the NLTB under the Chairmanship of former Prime Minister Mr. Qarase.

Paragraph 2.1 of Exhibit 3, Memorandum of Association says that VDCL "to be the Commercial vehicle for NLTB as trustee for the Fijian landowners as stipulated under Native Land Trust Act Cap 134". He then submitted the "Particulars of Directors and Secretaries and of any changes therein", Form No. 263 of VDCL as presented by NLTB to Registrar of Companies marked as Exhibit No. 6.

The Board of VDC continues to meet regularly, and has quite a number of joint venture proposals on its plate. (viii) Exhibit No. 48 - 366th NLTB Board Meeting Minutes dated 24th June 2004. - Paragraph 16.2 is on VDCL and the relevant portion is reproduced in paragraph 23of this chapter. (ix) Exhibit No. 66 - 367th NLTB Board Papers to be held on 26th August 2004. - General Manager's Report for months of July and August 2004 (page 23) - Paragraph 6 of page 28 VDCL and PCX 6.0 Vanua Development Corporation & PacificConnex Ltd (PCX) " The Board of VDC continues to meet on a monthly basis.

(xi) Exhibit No. 77 - 368th NLTB Board Papers to be held on 28th October 2004. - General Manager's Report for August and September 2004 at page 26 - Paragraph 5.2 of page 30 is on VDCL and PCX.

However, we have made representations and hope that the decision would be made in our favour. (xii) Exhibit No. 78 - 368th NLTB Board Meeting Minutes dated 28th October 2004. - Paragraph 3.4 about VDCL and PCX has already reproduced in paragraph 23of this chapter. 45. Facing cross examination, Mr. Toga said that he never transcribed the tape recording though it was in his custody, but went through the tape recording for assistance when preparing the Board minutes. He told court that he feels that he captured all the important business of the meetings faithfully to be recorded in minutes. 46. Referring to paragraph 5.2 Exhibit 77, the witness said that all what he knows is that PCX's bid for Government tender was unsuccessful and had PCX succeeded the bid, it would have been a huge business for them. Comparing this paragraph (5.2) with paragraph 3.4.2 of Exhibit 78, the defence counsel suggested that the latter would not reflect that PCX's efforts to get a potentially millions of dollars' worth of business might not happen. Mr. Toga, in responding, said that he can't recall what transpired at that time. Then it was suggested to Mr. Toga that the 'minutes' are intended only to be a "Summary" of what being discussed during the meetings and that 'summary' is 'quite inadequate'. The witness did not accept this. Mr. Keene, QC further suggested that the General Manager's report based on the press information does not even refer in these minutes. 47. Answering the questions over the Common Seal, Mr. Toga said that it was kept with his Secretary under lock and key. He said that the Secretary had the keys and given instructions to provide the seal either to him or Mr. Bakani, the General Manager. Mr. Toga repeated what he said in his evidence-in-chief, a NLTB contract to be binding, it needs the common seal to be affixed and the Board's approval is required before the seal is affixed to the said document. He further agreed with the defence counsel that if a document is a contract and if it does not under the seal, it is not binding on in NLTB. He qualified his view saying that "any organization or company should always have its seal affixed to any document for that document to be legally binding". Mr. Toga confirmed that during his period in NLTB he acted according to the provisions of Native Land Trust Act and especially section 3 (6). 48. Mr. Toga agreed with Mr. Keene, QC that being the NLTB Secretary, for him to put the common seal on a document he must first have a Board resolution. Whilst admitting Exhibit 6A, (Deed For Holding Shares In Trust In VDCL) and Exhibit 36 (Business Solution Agreement between NLTB and PCX), being important documents for NLTB, signed without affixing the NLTB Common Seal, Mr. Toga went on to say that there are many other documents of NLTB, such as employment contracts, which were not signed under the common seal. 49. Mr. Toga recalled that he was the Board Secretary to VDCL as well while being the Secretary to NLTB. He said that he played a very little role in VDCL, particularly in preparation of documentation needed to set-up the company as Mr. Bakani and Mr. Tuinamuana handled that. Finally, he said that he cannot assist the court on the issue whether a 'consent letter' was obtained by Mr. KD to take-up the role of a Director as required by Section 183 of the Companies Act. He told court that he expect the company (VDCL) to run according to the rules laid down in its Articles of Association and the provisions of the Companies Act. 50. In re-examination, Mr. Toga said that no discussion took place about PCX's unsuccessful bid to government contract during the Board meeting as it was already in the Board Paper and had he omitted any material about PCX, it could have brought to his attention in the next meeting. Prosecution Witness #4 Mr. Necava Bakaniceva 51. Mr. Bakaniceva had been appointed Board Secretary of the NLTB in November 2004 and served in that office until August 2006. He identified Mr. KD as a member of the NLTB Board during his period and said that he is familiar with Mr. KD's handwriting and signature. Referring to Mr. Bakani, the General Manager of NLTB, he took up the same stance. The Common Seal of NLTB, he said that it was not kept under lock and key but with his personal Secretary and it was only he had the access and authority to use it. He confirmed Mr. Toga's version, that the seal would be used or affixed together with a Board member and a resolution of the Board is required to do so. 52. Mr. Toga's narration about the role of the Board Secretary and the procedure of Board Meetings was almost endorsed by Mr. Bakaniceva as well. By the time he took over the office, the witness said that he knows about VDCL and Mr. KD was its Chairman and Mr. Bakani was a Director along with Mr. Nalin Patel, Mr. Daniel Whippy and Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira. 53. Then Mr. Bakaniceva was referred to the following documents.

Mr. Bakaniceva, in cross examination accepted that whenever it refers to NLTB Management, it does not include the members of the Board. He agreed that his source of memory over the events which took place in the Board Meetings comes largely from the documents seen and shown to him. Witness said for him to affix the seal on a document, he must have the Board resolution to go ahead and if not he returns the document. 55.

He said he cannot recall sighting any letter of Re-appointment of Mr. KD to continue as a member of NLTB once his first term expired in December 2004. Then the witness was taken back to certain exhibits cited to him during his evidence-in-chief. (i) Exhibit No. 92 - Paragraph 4. - (This is been reproduced inparagraph 53 for this chapter). Witness agreed that the assurance of General Manager to NLTB Board to present a Paper at every future Board Meeting was his own offer but not because the Board demanded for it. - Paragraph 4.3.3 is been reproduced in paragraph 53of this chapter. It says the General Manager advised to the Board that the NLTB is the Shareholder of VDCL, it appoints the Directors, VDCL operates strictly under its. Article of Association and if the NLTB Board wants to inform the companies it owns about the commercial developments that the Board wants to pursue. - Witness agreed that General Manager's contention in paragraph 4.3.3 is to remind the NLTB Board that VDCL is a separate legal company and that separation needs to be respected and NLTB must have the comfort because it appoints the Directors to VDCL Board. - Witness confirmed that VDCL Directors have operated according to its Articles of Association or VDCL's Rules, where the rights of the shareholders are defined by the Articles. - The last bullet point, the witness agreed, is to say that if there is something that NLTB wishes to pass on to VDCL it should be in a formal way and Mr. Bakani is saying the NLTB Board that you have a 100% owned subsidiary company on its own rules to which shareholders are also bound. - The witness endorsed the suggestion of Mr. Keene QC, that this discussion about VDCL happened on 14th December 2004, a year after its establishment, which says that "if you want we will give you a report and volunteered". (ii) Exhibit No. 97 - Item 3 of "Matters Arising" VDCL and PCX Issues; Paper to be presented at the next meeting. - Paragraph 5 A Paper on NLTB, VDCL and PCX financial relationship and details to be tabled at the next meeting. - No complaint by any member for not gettingthe report as promised. (iii)Exhibit No. 133 - Item 21 refers to Information Paper No. 066/2005, which goes for over 40 pages dealing with number of elements related to VDCL and PCX affairs. - Witness agreed that General Manager fulfilled his offer to the NLTB Board for a full report on these two companies. - Item 21.3 is on PCX and fully reproduced under the 4th point ofparagraph 53of this chapter. - It says, PCX loss of $230, 431 against a budget loss of $371,891 and PCX had applied for a loan of $7 million with FDB to refinance its costs associated with development of NLTB system but approved only $3.5 million. - Witness agreed that it is telling the Board that it was identified by PCX that they need for external funding of $7 million and they got only half of that amount. - Referring to item 21.4, Deliberations, witness agreed that when the Chairman informed that the information on VDCL was clear and the affairs of PCX seemed to be cloudy especially in the movements of funds like $7 million and the Management to submit a report every 3 months, it means that the paid management staff led by Mr. Bakani, the General Manager is to do the reporting. (iv) ExhibitNo. 156 - Paragraph 7, Annual Accounts Board Paper 016/2005. - General Manager apologized for delay in tabling the audited accounts, citing two reasons and informed the Board that audited accounts for the two companies will be tabled at the next Board Meeting (Reproduced in paragraph 53 of this chapter) (v) Exhibit No. 187 - Page 83 VDCL and PCX Information Paper 002/2006. - Page 93 financial details of VDCL and PCX (Appendix 1) - Page 107 Financial Statement of VDCL 31st December 2004. - Page 107 Price Waterhouse Coopers' Audit Report (PWC) - Page 112 Explanatory Notes to the Figures. - No complains or questions about the completeness and accuracy of this information - Page 121 PCX Sales Report January 2006 - Page 122 Sales Funnel - Page 123 PCX Financial Statement for 31st December 2004. - Page 128 PWC's Audit letter - Witness agreed that supply of this sort of information is exactly the information that Shareholders are entitled to get under the Companies Act as the supply of PCX information effectively explains the relationship between PCX and VDCL. He repeated that there was no complaint from the NLTB Board members about the failure to get information raised by them and had they wanted to raise any concerns or complaints they could have done so under "Matters Arising". (vi) Exhibit No. 99 - Mr. Bakani's letter to Mr. Qarase, Prime Minister as a Director of VDCL dated 18th February 2005. - Regarding the $million government grant in 2005. - Highlighted portions of the attached Memorandum are reproduced under paragraph 53(v)of this chapter. - Witness claimed that he cannot recall whether this government grant was made subject to any condition or not and said the purpose of the said grant was for NLTB to buy some more paid-up shares in VDCL whilst that money goes into the books of VDCL as its working capital because it is not appropriate to have security from a company in relation to its own working capital. - Finally, in cross examination, the witness agreed that there was a problem in LALI system or NLTB's Land Administration Software System because of dirty data going into it when it was supposed to go live. 59. In Re-examination, referring to Exhibit KD 4, the Sealing Register, Mr. Bakaniceva said that it is necessary to affix the common seal on contracts, guarantees or loan documents as its purpose was to inform the NLTB Board the amount of transactions that has been sealed. The 'transactions' are mainly lease documents as the leasing lands within the Board's responsibility. Witness agreed with Mr. Blanchflower, SC, that the operating words in KD 5 is "operated for the benefit of all Fijians". Talking on KD 6, the witness agreed that both FAB and GCC make decisions for the benefit of all Fijians and that is the purpose of the said "Fund" as well.

(Reproduced in paragraph 53 (v)point in this chapter) Prosecution Witness # 5 Mr. Kolinio Boila 61. Mr. Boila had joined the NLTB as a Management Accountant on 15th December 2003. He was under the direct supervision of Mr. Joveci Tuinamuana, the Deputy General Manager of NLTB. Mr. Joveci was under Mr. Bakani, the General Manager of NLTB. Mr. Joveci is said to be deceased. Mr. Boila had been promoted to Manager, Finance of NLTB in April 2004 and resigned from the same in December 2006. Being the Manager, Finance, he said that he was responsible with the overall and direct supervision of the financial functions and activities of the financial arm of the Board. 62. Mr. Boila said that he was aware that NLTB had approved the formation of VDCL as its investment and business arm. When VDCL commenced its operations in January 2004, Mr. Boila had been the Acting Board Secretary of VDCL, more precisely, February 2004 to August 2004. There were no paid employees in VDCL at that time, Mr. Boila said. Identifying Mr. KD, the witness said that he was the Chairman of VDCL with Mr. Bakani, Mr. Patel, Mr. Whippy and Mr. Kaloumaira as other Directors. 63. Mr. Boila said that he took his shorthand notes of the Board Minutes without a back-up tape recorder and the draft minutes were first sent to Mr. Bakani and after the necessary amendments, those minutes were been circulated to the other members via e-mail. Once the Minutes are confirmed at the next Board Meeting, Mr.KD, the Chairman signed the minutes. He also confirmed that if any Board Member found out that if he had omitted something important discussed or needed any correction, they had the opportunity to do so at the next Board Meeting as draft minutes were circulated minimum 2 days prior to the next meeting. Apart from this responsibility, he said that he looked after petty cash, Cheque book and also the general ledgers of VDCL. After the appointment of Mr. Aisake Saukawa as the Secretary to the Board, Mr. Boila had been relieved from that position. 64. Commenting on transfer of funds from NLTB to VDCL, the witness said that Mr. Bakani instructed him to do so and the NLTB Board decided what funds and the amount of funds to be transferred to VDCL. He said that initially "two groups" of funds were transferred, first, the funds already confirmed by the GCC and handled under NLTB's finance side (around $3.5 million) and second the funds which were awaiting confirmation of Extinct Mataqali Funds. (more than $3 million) Prior to this transfer to VDCL, he said that those funds of both types were largely invested in shares, stock bonds and Term Deposits in various places, including Unit Trust of Fiji, Fijian Holdings Trust, Colonial Finance, ANZ, Merchants Finance and Credit Corporation. The "transfer of funds" had carried out by requesting various companies to transfer the shares or term deposits or stocks or bonds from NLTB's name to VDCL's name. 65.

(viii) Exhibit No. 157- E-mail from Mr. Boila to Mr. Aisake Saukawa, the next witness, who was the Secretary to VDCL at that time, 23rd of September 2005; regarding the additional PCX loan. "Subject: Additional PCX Loan Aisake, As per our discussions on the above topic, from NLTB's point of view, further loan to PCX will increase exposure to VDC. Auditors normally conduct impairment loss assessments in order to evaluate returns on current investments. Further loan to PCX can increase provisions of "loss on investments". In NLTB's books if assessment of investments in PCX at the end of the year is not in NLTB & VDC's favour. We are talking about more than $3m loss adjusted against NLTB's 2005 surplus. Also important to note that it is not wise to keep assigning PCX contract with NLTB as security over the loan. Profit margin to PCX on NLTB project was not much and assigning future funds against current loans will affect operational cashflows for PCX, which in turn affect PCX's support for NLTB SAP system. For Considrations. Vinaka. Boila." - Mr. Boila had not copied this email to anybody else and did not recall any response from Mr. Saukawa. (x) Exhibit No. 180- VDCL Investment Register as at 31st December 2005. 68. At the commencement of the cross examination, Mr. Boila said that he has some recollection on some of the events apart from the documents, such as movements of funds from NLTB to VDCL, initial portion of funds moved to PCX from VDCL, financial statements of VDCL, some major transactions took place and some important documentation including Mr. Bakani's signature. 69. Witness agreed that his appointment and employment contract was with NLTB but involved in providing NLTB accounting services to VDCL. He said that for NLTB matters he took direct instructions from Deputy General Manager of NLTB, Mr. Joveci Tuinamuana, but on VDCL matters, directly from Mr. Bakani. But, Mr. Boila said that 95% of his work was in NLTB, whilst the rest with VDCL. Mr. Boila recalled that it was one Mr. Vitusagavulu was the Consultant who made the proposal to the NLTB Board to have a separate commercial investment arm. He agreed that the idea behind VDCL was it to be able to go out and make investments that the NLTB itself could not do and that is the reason for VDCL to be a separate corporation. 70. Then the attention of the witness was drawn to the following Exhibits. (i) Exhibit No. 11- Paragraph 6; current NLTB Investment Portfolio talks about NLTB own funds. - Paragraph 8; $1 million Interest free loan from Government to NLTB; is a Capital grant. But, actually received amount was around $747,000. - Transfer of current NLTB Investments; $1,684,853 is mentioned in Table 2 of paragraph 6 as Fijian Holdings Limited "A" Class shares. - $1,569,208 is mentioned in paragraph 6 as the amount of 'Special Fund' created in 1999. - These are NLTB's own money and some of its income was to help the payments of the renovations of its head office. - Transfer of Investments in Trust Fund; $3,440,402 is reflected in paragraph 7 under "Other investments and General Term Deposits". - Witness agreed that $1,684, 853 and $1,569, 208 are "NLTB's own funds" and $3,440,402 is "Trust Funds". (ii) Exhibit No. 9 - Paragraph 7.4 is the reflection of what discussed under Exhibit 11. - Clarifies how the initial paid up capital of $7.7 million made up of (Total is $7,694,463). - Paragraph 7.10.1; VDCL is to commence operations by 1st January 2004 as 31st of December 2003, the financial year of NLTB ends. - Paragraph 7.10.4 (Resolved) as follows: FAB to be requested to approve the transfer of funds in the Trust Fund which belongs to it as equity in VDC.Moreover that they be approached for a grant or interest free loan of $1m as additional equity of VDC. Witness said that FAB's approval was never sought according to his recollection, but probably the Management was confident that they will be able to get the process through. He further said that the Board paper recommended to ask FAB to use that $3.4 million as FAB's equity in VDCL to earn more interests but the approval was not obtained at that point of time. "In contrary, Mr. Boila said the first three figures, $1 million Government loan, Class "A" shares of FHL and investments done with the 'Special Fund' were NLTB's own money. (paragraph 7.10.3) - He recalled that according to this resolution, VDCL's Authorized Capital is to be $20 million and paid up capital is to be $7.7 million. He said that $3.4 million of Extinct Mataqali Funds were not treated as 'capital' of VDCL, but an advance or loan VDCL as a borrowing from NLTB. It was suggested to Mr.Toga that subsequently, notwithstanding the lack of consent of FAB, the funds were treated as equity by FAB. - (Paragraph 11 of Exhibit 202 is reproduced in paragraph 53in this chapter) - Mr. Boila maintained that $3.4 million of Extinct Mataqali Funds cannot be considered as VDCL 'paid-up capital' and in fact agreed that, in that event there won't be a paid-up capital of $7.7 million as the NLTB Board resolved on 18th December 2003. - Mr. Boila went on to say that there was a "Trust Deed" signed by NLTB confirming "that the funds transferred to VDCL in its hands its holding in trust on behalf of NLTB". He identified Exhibit 6A, DEED FOR HOLDING SHARES IN TRUST IN THE VDCL dated 19th of March, 2004, as the "Trust Deed" he referred to and in support of his contention by citing its 3rd paragraph of the 1st page. Whereas the parties to this Deed are desirous that the beneficial interests of the VDCL Shareholders in the dealings of the property in the new Company and the proceeds derived thereof shall remain the property of the Board in the hands of the VDCL shareholders. And that the properties of the company shall not be assigned, transferred or dealt with in any way except as hereinafter provided. He agreed with Mr. Keene, QC, that the "proceeds derived" shall remain in the hands of 'VDCL Shareholders but not VDCL itself. But, Mr. Boila said that though VDCL was not a party to this Trust Deed, three persons from VDCL had been signatories to it. He further said that it was his personal opinion at that time that the 'Trust Deed' permitted NLTB to lend trust funds to VDCL and therefore not be in breach of its obligations relating to the trust funds. (iii) Exhibit KD 9 - This contained 5 e-mails exchanged between Mr. Boila and Mr. Bakani on the issue of $3.4 million Extinct Mataqali Funds transferring to VDCL pending FAB approval. - Mr. Boila said he proceeded to transfer the Extinct Mataqali Funds as instructed by Mr. Bakani, though he understood the accounting implications. - Then he agreed if that $3.4 million Extinct Mataqali Funds was not the capital of VDCL where VDCL is going to be the trustee for that loan, part of the resolution, the paid-up capital of VDCL to be $7.7 million, was not met and he cannot recall whether the NLTB Board members knew these things at that time as he has no evidence to say whether Mr. Bakani relayed that information to the Board. (iv) Exhibit No. 38- Witness agreed that the three withdrawals from ANZ ($202,104.11), Credit Corporation ($248, 998.95) and Merchant Investments ($250, 000) were a part of monies consisted of $2 million loan to PCX and that is out of the Extinct Mataqali Funds transferred to VDCL. (v) Exhibit No. 45- [c] VDCL Board approved the $2 million loan request of PCX on 23rd June 2004. Witness confirmed that though he was present in this meeting, he did not pass the information to the Board that the PCX loan money is not only the own capital or equity of VDCL. - But, he said that he is not sure whether the Board asked for the source of the $2 million. Nevertheless, he said that the information was provided to Mr. Bakani. - Witness could not confirm whether the real reason as to why the information was not provided to the Board was Mr. Bakani did not want to do so. But, he admitted that he and the NLTB treated this money as "NLTB Trust Money". - Referring back to Exhibit 38, the Investment Register of VDCL as at 31st March 2004, Mr. Boila said that he could have taken money from the 1st cage, "NLTB Investments Transferred to VDCL" or NLTB's own funds, but because of the urgency of the request, he was asked about the funds which can be redeemed within 5 working days and he answered to Mr. Bakani accordingly. - The total sum that can be redeemed within 5 working days, according to the above Investment Register was $3,153,220.97. Answering the counsel as to why he did not focus only on their own capital in the 1st cage, Mr. Boila said that there were insufficient funds in that pool as FHL "A" Class will take time to redeem and there is no point of exchanging a 20% dividend to 9%. - Mr. Boila agreed that $200, 000 (ANZ, Credit Corporation and Merchant Finance withdrawals) of Extinct Mataqali Funds went into the $2 million PCX loan as Mr. Bakani's view was, to which he also had to agree because Mr. Bakani was his boss, that VDCL could do whatever it liked whether its NLTB's own funds or Trust Funds. But, he said, that he would "probably disagree" to lent $700,00 of NLTB's Trust money for a term of 2 years being the trustee of the funds. - Mr. Boila told that to lend the said $700,000, NLTB Board approval is needed and that would have been his answer had any Board member raised that issue at that meeting. If something had happened to the finances of VDCL or the company, Mr. Boila agreed that the trust funds could have got back because they are trust funds. Yet for all, the witness volunteered to say that he has no experience on proper risk assessment of investments and corporate governance at that time. - Basically what Mr. Boila said was that NLTB had its own money in its finance section and trust funds of various categories of people in its trust section. (vi) Exhibit KD-8 - NLTB's Annual Report for year 2004. - Page 43 witness said $5,526, 374 under "Receivable from related parties" in "Current Assets" includes "Extinct Mataqali Funds". This figure is cross referenced to 6 (b) at page 45. The figure there $3, 369, 848, according to Mr. Boila is $3.4 million of EMF and the difference is due to the changing values of investments. 6 (b) is cross referenced to 6 (e), where it says "The funds advanced to VDCL relates to income on unallocated vacant lands. The Board, from its own funds, has guaranteed the repayment of all monies advanced to VDCL". Mr. Boila said that he understands that to be the interpretation of the Auditors according to their knowledge of "Trust Fund" and "Trust Deed". (vii) Exhibit No. 45- Mr. Boila was referred to this exhibit for the 2nd time. He agreed that the $2 million PCX loan was for the interest rate of 9% and the funds that reflect were earning much less than that. With the improved return for VDCL, witness agreed that an Assignment of NLTB Annual lease payment of $1.3 million was taken as security. Mr. Boila said that he did not have a view, whether that was a sensible business or not as he did not have any knowledge of the formal approval of the NLTB. (viii) Exhibit No. 51- Loan Offer from VDCL to PCX for $2 million loan. - Establishment Fee was $15,000 (equivalent to 0.7% of the borrowing) - Witness confirmed receiving that amount. - Witness then agreed that $15,000 Establishment Fee is more to the total amount of two break fees or penalty charges for early redemption ($7,900 and $2,400) by Credit Corporation and Merchant Finance. (ix) Exhibit KD 10- PCX Financial Statements - Year ending 31st December 2004. 71. Answering the questions of Mr. Blanchflower, SC in re-examination, Mr. Boila said in NLTB there were only two types of funds in one bank account, but for the accounting purposes, it was divided into different sub accounts based on different categories of assets, liabilities and equity. But, he said that they all were NLTB Funds. 72. Then Mr. Boila was taken again through several exhibits. " Exhibit No. 11- Citing paragraph 2 (already reproduced in paragraph 6 of this chapter) Witness said the main objectives of VDCL were to invest the funds it received from NLTB to generate additional revenue for the NLTB, enjoy a greater autonomy in its operations and to properly manage landowner's investments, which is between $9-12 million at any time, in the Trust Fund. - Referring to figures in paragraph 7, Mr. Boila said that the Special Fund of $1,569,208 (paragraph 6) along with Native Owner's investments, other investments and General Term Deposits and the Cash Balance of $3 million are included in the "Trust Fund" of $9,917, 468.

This has been invested in Vanua Development Corporation Ltd." - Talking about Mr. Bakani, the witness said he got instructions from Mr. Bakani as the General Manager of NLTB and Director of VDCL. He said he was the Board Secretary of VDCL and was responsible of taking minutes of the meetings that he attended and did not have any decision making responsibility or requiring to give advice to VDCL Board. Pointing to 6 (a) (Government Grants other) the witness endorsed that the owners of a company are Shareholders and the Directors have a duty to act in the best interest of that Shareholders. In this case, Mr. Boila confirmed that VDCL Shareholders (3) were employees of NLTB. " Exhibit No. 6A- Trust Deed. - Going back to paragraph three (3) of its 1st page(reproduced inparagraph 70of this chapter)Mr. Boila admitted that it has not distinguished the "types of property", but refers to "all the property". - Page 2, Defines what "Trust Property" is.

Mr. Bakani, Mr. KD and Mr. Kaloumaira had supported the proposal in the following terms. " Mr. Bakani - 1. The initial request was for $500,000.00 but because we had to prepay this Term Deposit of $900,000.00, further discussions resulted in the increase amount. This is of benefit to VDCL as the returns will be higher. 2.

PCMS has effectively capitalized PCX by this amount by not enforcing the terms of its contract and amounts to an interest free loan to PCX. - Page 4; (viii)Other Payables TUI has paid additional expenses on behalf of PCX and is due this amount. A loan of $2,900,000 is due to Vanua and a loan of $1,000,000 to Dominion Finance has been used to repay TUI Inc for SAP and Oracle Software licenses and maintenance, SUN hardware and fund some of the PCX operating expenses. - Mr. Saukawa agreed that the above two paragraphs reflect the owing of PCX to: i.

Dominion Finance - $1 million (loan) - Page 4; 3FUNDING CASH FLOW The proposed NLTB refinancing deal will assist PCX greatly with being able to pay off its debts and maintain a reasonable capital reserve.

It is also noted that VDCL will need to consolidate the accounts of PCX, and accordingly borrowings by PCX would get reflected in the group accounts of VDCL. The directors agreed that the arrangements between VDCL and PCX and the accounts of PCX needs to be urgently reviewed to assess the current position, its implications and to determine how it can better manage the financial transactions of the two entities. - Witness did not recall the Directors who raised those concerns as he had not recorded in the minutes.

It was minuted in our last meeting, although still in draft form, that Mr. Bakani's submission to the NLTB Board about PCX was to be circulated to members to keep them informed about PCX's financial status and to remove the stigma about its viability as a going concern. The stigma was in reference to profitability and in particular the effect of borrowings against equity, net assets and future income streams and its impact on consolidation with the holding company, VDCL. However the Board approved the circulation of the NLTB submission and therefore it is incumbent upon you to action these requests. Can you please confirm today that this will be circulated. I would like also today answers to the following questions: 1. Has Vanua Development Corporation Ltd provided guarantees or securities to ANZ Bank for a loan of $1.0 million by PCX. If yes, under what authority were these issued, when were they issued and why has this not been ratified by the Board yet. 2. Has Vanua Development Corporation Ltd provided guarantees to Credit Corporation Limited for a loan of $600,000 by PCX? If yes, under what authority was this issued and if it was after our last Board Meeting when the matter was declined, why was it provided. 3. Has Vanua Development Corporation Ltd provided guarantees to support a PCX $1.0 million loan from Vinod Patel. If yes, under what authority was this issued and when was it issued. Why has the Board been kept in the dark about this transaction. - 3rd e-mail; Mr. Whippy to Mr. Saukawa dated 26th July 2005 reads as follows: "Mr. Whippy Thank you for your concerns. May I answer in the sequence that the questions were raised: 1. I will circulate the NLTB submissions once Mr. Bakani gives me the OK since it is with him. 2. The Vanua guarantee to ANZ was circulated and approved by 3 Board of Directors. Copies of their approval is in file. 3. There was a request to guarantee this Loan to Credit Corp but this is no longer needed as Credit Corp has approved the loan on the basis of an assignment over the NLTB proceeds to PCX. They are to be ranked second to FDB. This arrangement has nothing to do with VDCL. 4. The $1million loan from Vinod Patel is an arrangement between PCX and Vinod Patel and has nothing to do with VDCL. 5. As for the cross guarantee to Vinod Patel, this is new to me and was never arranged. 6. I hope that answers your concerns, but please let me know if there are other areas that needs clarifications and I would most certainly attend to them promptly.

(i) Exhibit No. 169- PCX Board Meeting Papers for 20th October 2005. - Purpose of this meeting was to confirm the Board Meeting Minutes of 27th July 2005 and 12th September 2005 (Special Board Meeting) - Board Meeting Minutes dated 27th July 2005. 1. Page 3; Paragraph 7 Information Papers 2. Corporate Report (Information paper 005/2005) The Directors noted the Corporate report as presented.

"PCX has for the year and a half signed 3 major deals basically with NLTB, SCA Hygiene and currently Vinod Patel. PCX offered NLTB substantial savings in their contract by drastically reducing it by $2.9m from the initial $18.9m to $16.040m. This arrangement was offered to NLTB subject to NLTB assisting PCX on the refinancing of the implementation costs of the NLTB system to a tune of $7.5m. Unfortunately this did not transpire as FDB only refinanced $3.6m leaving a balance of $3.9m outstanding. It is because of this reason that PCX had to resort to acquiring funds from other sources like Dominion Finance [$1m] then ANZ and Unity Finance [$1m] to be able to finance the NLTB implementation costs. Unfortunately this has led to another problem whereby Vinod Patel has held back payment due to PCX for the implementation of their system to a tune of $0.5m.

Additionally given the substantial interest gain of 10%, the guaranteed principal repayment from the NLTB contract and the undertaking that all debt will be cleared first once the recapitalisation of the wireless business takes place including the considerable contribution of $1.0m by the minority shareholder, this facility is recommended for approval subject to:" - According to the Westpac letter dated 20th September 2005 to Mr. Khan, $25,000 been transferred to PCMS and $300,000 to PCX from Mr. Khan's personal account. - PCX letter dated 22nd September 2005 to Price Waterhouse Cooper, $750, 000 Management fees due to PCMS from PCX had been waived off. - Profit and Loss Statement of VDCL for August 2005 shows (6th item) no entry of PCX dividend to VDCL, and the witness said that implies no dividends has been received from PCX. - Later, Mr. Saukawa, referring to Exhibit 125 agreed that VDCL was not a Guarantor to PCX loan of $3.6 million from FDB and his entry including this transaction in "VDCL Exposure in PCX' (page 4) was a misjudgement.

(xviii) Exhibit No. 203- VDCL Investment Register as at 30th June 2006 confirms $3.9 million loans in three different items. 90. After two full days of Evidence-in-chief, Mr. Saukawa's cross examination started on 7th of July 2014. At the very beginning, Mr. Saukawa agreed with Mr. Keene, QC, that he did not go through all the documents, Board Papers, Minutes, e-mails shown to him by the prosecution and if he says 'no' in respect of any issue pertaining to a document, that means it does not reflect on it. Further he said that he cannot say what is on the minutes he has not read and he did not have any access to NLTB material or documents when preparing to give evidence. 91. Mr. Saukawa said that he is not confident that he handed over all the documents of PCX that existed to the prosecution as some of the documents were taken by the lawyers of R. Patel & Company and some by the Military after December 2006 coup. Referring to Exhibit KD-8, witness said that "All the original minutes were taken by FICAC through RMF (Tom) on 21/01/2008. Documents have yet to be returned to the office." He explained that all the originals of Board minutes, 2005, 2006, 2007 were all stuck together in the file for the minutes and those documents did not come back to him. 92. The signing of documents in PCX and VDCL, witness said that most were done by Mr. Bakani, himself and Ms. Alanieta as staff members, but when a document needed a signature outside the staff, they took it to relevant Directors office to be signed, whoever available on that day and there is no real significance who this outside signatory was. 93. Mr. Keene, QC, drew the attention of Mr. Saukawa to Exhibit 37,Exhibit 68 and Exhibit 242 to clarify Mr. Saukawa's comment in his evidence-in-chief that Pacific Contract Management Services Limited (PCMS) as being a Shareholder in PCX. Exhibit 68, PCX Certificate of Shares, shows 490, 000 'B' class ordinary shares were owned by PMSIL (Pacific Management Services International Limited) which is a registered company in the British Virgin Islands. (Exhibit 242). Mr. Saukawa admitted that it was PMSIL who owned the shares in PCX with VDCL, but not PCMS. 94. Mr. Saukawa was then taken through his letter of appointment, Exhibit 69. He agreed that he commenced work on 20th September 2004 as a Research Administration Officer for VDCL. He admitted that he was paid by NLTB, though he was involved in VDCL work. He described how he engaged with the accountabilities stated in his letter of Appointment. VDCL's Investment Policy is one instance he had assisted in documenting company's management policies. Witness agreed that "conducting analytical research work" is to do with investments and whenever he prepares investment papers and make recommendations, he gave effect to this obligation under his employment contract. Mr. Saukawa said that he, without any debate, did allow things to be put in by Mr. Bakani, though he himself disagrees, as Mr. Bakani was his superior. 95. Witness said that VDCL office was situated in the NLTB Building and all the VDCL documents were held in his office. He explained that "preparation of payments to all VDCL creditors" was partly kept with Manager Finance, of NLTB Finance Unit. Mr. Saukawa agreed that what he did in VDCL applied for PCX as well when he was appointed as its Secretary. Referring to the contractual obligation of "preparation of all payments to creditors" of PCX, witness said that it was handled by PCX finance team and not by him. 96. Mr. Saukawa said that his first Board Meeting as VDCL Secretary was on 13th October 2004 (Exhibit 74) and the Investment Policy was adopted by the members on that day. Whilst admitting that as VDCL company Secretary his office was in the premises of NLTB, he said that he never took part in any of the NLTB Meetings, but went to Mr. Bakani if something is to be done in NLTB. Witness refused any involvement of him in preparation of audited financial statements, apart from giving documents, and said preparation of VDCL's financial statements was done by Mr. Boila. Flying minutes or minutes by e-mail, according to the witness, were sent out through Mr. Bakani's office, under his instructions. But, after sighting Exhibit KD-13, an e-mail chain, to which Mr. Saukawa and the Directors involved, dated 27th and 28th of April 2005, witness admitted that there were instances where he communicated with the Directors through e-mails, especially after the military coup in 2006. 97. Speaking of the other VDCL Board Members apart from Mr. KD, witness said Mr. Nalin Patel, Mr. Daniel Whippy, Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira and Mr. Bakani were senior business figures in Fiji community with a lot of business experience. Amongst them, Mr. Saukawa said that Mr. KD was the least experience out of the lot and he got the minutes of the past meetings approved; put Board Papers/Administration issues, which were prepared by the management, including Mr. Bakani, to the Board, allowed debate on the individual issues among the Directors, would summarise what he undertook to be the view of the people around the table and resolved or passed the issue. 98. Witness agreed that Mr. Bakani's role of being the Managing Director was open to debate. (Exhibit 112; VDCL Board Minutes dated 16th March 2005, [b] (vii) Appointment of Managing Director Directors noted the paper that was tabled and agreed to have the Chairman and Director Nalin Patel reassess it.) Then, Exhibit 113, the Confirmation of Appointment Letter to Mr. Saukawa by Mr. Bakani dated 17th March 2005, the following day to the 16th Meeting, Mr. Bakani had signed as the Managing Director of VDCL. Exhibit 117, VDCL Board Minutes dated 13th April 2005, [b] (v) also repeats the issue of "Appointment of Managing Director" in the same way like Exhibit 112, that the Chairman and Mr. Patel to reassess it. Witness agreed Mr. Bakani signing Exhibit 113, on 17th March 2005 as Managing Director is premature and he is not sure whether Mr. Bakani became the Managing Director of VDCL or not. 99. Mr. Saukawa said the VDCL Directors who got appointed as PCX Directors got their Director's fee in PCX. But, he said that according to his understanding, though the Confirmation of Appointment Letter (Exhibit 113) says "this will include the additional responsibilities of being the Company Secretary of PCX", the increased $4000 in his salary from $18,000 to $22,000 per annum, was because he was confirmed after being on probation. So, he denied that he got any extra payment for PCX work. 100. Mr. Saukawa was shown the "Sealing Register" of VDCL, which was marked as Exhibit KD-12. Referring to Exhibit 171, the VDCL Board Meeting minutes dated 21st October 2005, witness said that Directors agreed to ratify the 'Sealing Register' as presented from 2004 to that date and that is the reason for 21st October 2005 to appear in the 'Date of Ratification' column. Witness agreed that the single page (KD 12) shown to him is the beginning and end of the "Seal Register". (The original of this document was tendered and marked as Exhibit KD-12A). 101. Entry No. 05/2004 and 06/2004 in KD-12 was agreed to be in relation to PCX loan of $900,000. In 2005 entries, Nos. 03/2005, 04/2005, 05/2005, 06/2005 and 07/2005 was agreed by the witness to be related to VDCL Term Deposit Guarantee of ANZ over PCX loan of $1 million. The date seen to be in entry No. 03/2005 was said to be 27th of April 2005. 102. Recognising Exhibit KD-14, Deed of Assignment and Irrevocable Authority between VDCL, NLTB and PCX over the $2 million loan to PCX, Mr. Saukawa said that one VDCL signatory was Mr. Patel and he is not sure whether the other signatory was Mr. Kaloumaira or not. He added that this is an example of whoever Director is available signing documents. (Refer to paragraph 92of this chapter) 103. Mr. Saukawa agreed that he told in his evidence-in-chief that when the Directors passed resolutions, there could be dissenting Directors and his practice was not to record the dissent. But, he said that he cannot recall any occasion during the meetings where Directors raised their dissent or contacting him later asking that his dissent to be noted in minutes or before the confirmation of minutes asking his dissent to be recorded as Board Resolutions, as far as he could recall, were the view of all the Directors. Referring to his comment that Mr. Bakani appeared to have a good relationship with Mr. KD, witness said that it was simply a "good business relationship". 104. Witness was then referred to $900,000 loan of PCX. (i) Exhibit No. 75- PCX request for the loan, dated 16th November 2004. (Reproduced in paragraph 80 of this chapter) - Witness said that he did not see anything unusual or difficult about this request. (ii) Exhibit No. 79- VDCL Internal Memo, dated 17th November 2004, sent to the Directors with Mr. Saukawa's analysis of availability of funds. Exposure, Security and Recommendation, followed by the comments of Directors. (iii) Exhibit No. 83- Email chain between Mr. Saukawa, Mr. Dario Jaeger and Mr. Whippy along with several attachments. - Referring to the attached VDCL Investment Register as at November 2004, witness said it shows what would have happened if this $900,000 was approved. - After Mr. Saukawa sent the requested information to Whippy provided by Mr. Jaeger, he said that he cannot recall him receiving any response from Mr. Whippy. (Cross reference to paragraph 80 of this chapter). He added that PCX loan request of $900,000 was approved by the majority of Directors, (Mr. Bakani, Mr. KD and Mr. Kaloumaira) without Mr. Whippy and Mr. Patel, but Mr. Whippy was a party to the Board Resolution ratifying the relevant entries of the 'Seal Registry'. (Exhibit 171) (iv) Exhibit No. 170- VDCL Financial Statement, 31st December 2005 - Page 2 Basis of Accounting The directors believe that the basis of the preparation of accounts is appropriate and that the organisation will be able to continue its operations for at least 12 months from the date of the statement. Accordingly the directors believe the classification and carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities as stated in these accounts to be appropriate. - Page 3 Statement by Directors The accompanying balance sheet of the company is drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group at 31 December 2004. - Page 6 Balance sheet 31st December 2004 Non-current Assets Receivables 2,900,000 Cross reference (6) to "Receivables" is at Page 14 shows the two (2) loans given to PCX, $2 million and $900,000. Mr. Saukawa told court that when he recommended granting the loan of $900,000 to PCX (as per Exhibit 79, the VDCL internal memo dated 17th November 2004) he did not believe that anything was been done wrong as he believed the recommendation was for the best interest of VDCL because the loan gave a better rate of return than the replaced investment. 105. The next topic that Mr. Saukawa cross examined was the Investment Policy Guidelines, Exhibit 46. When referred to Exhibit 74, VDCL Board Minutes dated 13th October 2004 where the Board agreed to adopt the Investment Policy Guidelines, witness agreed that Mr. KD was not present in that meeting. Mr. Keene, QC, drew the attention to 2nd paragraph of the 'Introduction' of Investment Policy Guidelines to point out that it offered flexibility to the Board and Management when making investment decisions. (1st paragraph is already reproduced in paragraph 66 of this chapter) "The Investment Policy Statement is promised on performance measures used by a number of progressive investment funds in Fiji and Australia. It provides investment requirements that are quite general and offers flexibility to the Board and Management in making sound investment decisions on a case by case basis." He then highlighted that the exposure limit (already reproduced in paragraph 65 of this chapter) is not to be exceeded without Specific Board Approval. 106. Mr. Saukawa admitted that he pointed out these exposure guidelines in his Internal Memo (Exhibit 79) and a specific Board approval was taken to grant the PCX loan of $900,000. He went on to admit that the VDCL Board could decide to set new guidelines if it wanted to do so and the clauses mentioned by the counsel give the board to override the guidelines in specific cases, as they were only guidelines. 107. The next topic discussed with Mr. Saukawa was the Dominion Finance loan. (i) Exhibit No. 74- VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 13th October 2004 - [c] New Business (v) Members agreed to approach Dominion Finance and Credit Corporation for short term investments. (ii) Exhibit No. 112- VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 16th March 2005 - [c] New Business 1.2 (Already reproduced in paragraph 82 (vi)in this Chapter) - Witness agreed that there is nothing in the above Resolution about being any surety or any other arrangement. But, Mr. Saukawa said that there was another Resolution that made the $1 million VDCL Term Deposit in Dominion Finance to be treated a Security for something else and that Resolution was not produced to the court. He ultimately agreed with Mr. Keene, QC, that he was wrong when answered to Mr. Blanchflower, SC that there was a VDCL Term Deposit in Dominion Finance which was used as a Security for PCX loan facility of $1 million. 108. Mr. Keene, QC then passed on to ANZ Loan by PCX. (i) Exhibit No. 150- VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 10th August 2005. [c] New Business 3. Variation of VDCLguarantee over PCX O/D facility with ANZ; Directors agreed to formalize the variation for the next two months till end of September 2005. - Referring to series of other extensions of this particular ANZ Term Deposit, Mr. Saukawa said that the signing and sealing in number of documents were done as directed by Mr. Bakani. (ii) Exhibit No. 159- VDCL Board Papers for 28th September 2005. Board Paper No. 014/2005. Background PCX has for the year and a half signed 3 major deals basically with NLTB, SCA Hygiene and currently Vinod Patel. PCX offered NLTB substantial savings in their contract by drastically reducing it by $2.9m from the initial $18.9m to $16.040m. This arrangement was offered to NLTB subject to NLTB assisting PCX on the refinancing of the implementation costs of the NLTB system to a tune of $7.5m. Unfortunately this did not transpire as FDB only refinanced $3.6m leaving a balance of $3.9m outstanding. It is because of this reason that PCX had to resort to acquiring funds from other sources like Dominion Finance [$1m] then ANZ and Unity Finance [$1m] to be able to finance the NLTB implementation costs. Unfortunately this has led to another problem whereby Vinod Patel has held back payment due to PCX for the implementation of their system to a tune of $0.5m. This funds were meant for operational costs and has forced PCX to a critical situation. - Pointing to the last sentence of the above paragraph, 'This funds were meant for operational costs and has forced PCX to a critical situation", witness said that words "critical situation" are actually in this Board Paper and therefore he was wrong when answered Mr. Blanchflower, SC that there was no reference to PCX critical financial situations. 109. Mr. Saukawa said that PCX was a "starter" and was entering into business from afresh with its main business exploitation of an exclusive licence for MYSAP. The successful implementation of the NLTB contract was critical to PCX and though there were some technical problems, this system worked inside of NLTB to produce desired effects. He agreed that PCX put some weight on the fact that government got MYSAP licence and with NLTB started moving live there were some optimism that the other government departments will follow the course. But, the witness said that event did not happen. (i) Exhibit No. 132- NLTB Board Papers to be held on 5th May 2005 (ii) Page 101 2.1 Sales Funnel This company was incorporated in March 2004. Its main activity is in the introduction of the new SAP IT system into Fiji over which it has exclusive rights. Appendix 6 of the paper shows the sales funnel. The following points will be apparent: Two contracts have been signed and are now being attended to. These are NLTB and SCA Hygiene Australasia. The contracts that are about to be signed are C J Patel and Vinod Patel. Other companies and institutions that are being followed up are given on the list. One of the main difficulties the Company has experienced is processing business from within the civil service and the public sector generally. Decision making is delayed and uncertain. The interest expressed by the private sector (Vinod Patel & C J Patel) is most encouraging. The perception in the market place is that SAP is expensive. There are now available new versions which are suitable for the business sector. Whilst sales have not progressed as earlier expected, there is a lot of optimism for the second half of 2005. Page 109 VDCL Proposal Pipeline Diagram shows what contracts or proposals are in the pipeline what are high level discussions and where certain proposals being evaluated to indicate what the future business is. 110. It was agreed by Mr. Saukawa that when PCX was getting into the 3rd quarter of 2005, the expected Government businesses were not turning up except two sign ups with Vinod Patel and SCA Hygiene, while still servicing the NLTB contract. Then, he said that PCX had to look for other prospects and the issue of "3G wireless Licence", Mr. Saukawa said that after a research by PCX, it was decided that Vodafone had a monopoly on the system and there is a gap PCX could go in to have another service provider, probably another international telephone operator to come to Fiji market to provide the mobile phone services. He said that PCX thought of "Alcatel", a French company to be the right partner and had it worked out, it would have been a very big opportunity to a company like PCX. 111. Mr. Saukawa said that the later part of 2005 and throughout 2006, '3G Licence' became the main business focus of PCX and he himself involved in trying to bring this opportunity to a finality. He referred to a court case and said that as a result of running the court case, the government believed that Vodafone did not have a monopoly. (i) Exhibit No. 159- VDCL Board Paper No: 014 of 2005 PCX Mobile Wireless Business " Meetings between the Prime Minister and Mr. Ballu Khan took place last week on the PCX's proposed mobile licence. This was followed by a meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr. Kalivati Bakani together with Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira. Both the PCX and VDCL Board have been advised that the PCX mobile wireless licence will be issued soon and with this licence the re-capitalisation of PCX will result hence the full payment of all debts to VDCL including the FDB, ANZ, Credit Corp etc. " PCX has been in close contact with identified overseas investors who are apparently just waiting for the license to be issued and are looking at investing approximately $50.0m which will recapitalise PCX. " VDCL will be a major shareholder in this project and will own a very significant asset base. Mr. Ballu Khan has undertaken if required to dilute his share so that VDCL maintains majority shareholding and does not fall below 40%. This is a very significant concession in favour of VDCL. " PCX recapitalisation will commence in approximately 4-6 weeks. " Mr. Khan has also indicated making available USD $1m in about the next 6 weeks. Witness said that at one stage he believed that PCX will be granted the mobile licence as the government even asked PCX to draft the licence. He said though it did not happen, PCX continued to administer the NLTB contract. He agreed with Mr. Keene, QC, that VDCL was keen to make sure that PCX survived to get the licence signed and get this major injection of money. 112. The 'Military Intervention" in November, December 2006 was put to Mr. Saukawa as the next topic. Witness said it was one out of nine (9) demands by Commodore Bainimarama prior to the Military coup to shut down VDCL and that had "very drastic measures" on VDCL. After that demand, witness said that there was no VDCL Board constituted and by 2007 it was planned to get rid of the existing Board and appoint a new one. After the said demands, the witness said that the Directors were reluctant to move forward. 113. Speaking of 'PCX' Mr. Saukawa said that after the coup military officers armed with riffle and dressed in armoured compact arrived and raided the PCX office for several times and took all the documents whatever they can get from the office along with the server for the NLTB system, the main frame data processor that ran the MYSAP system, personal computers and his paper records and closed down the office. He said that he along with other staff, were scared of this development and was a frightening experience. 114. With these events and departure of staff, Mr. Saukawa said that PCX could not service the NLTB contract over the months of January, February and March of 2007. He said Mr. Bakani was put on indefinite leave from February 2007 whilst some others like Mr. Mua and Mr. Khan were banned from entering into NLTB premises. An expert from India had visited Fiji to reset the system with the expenses of Mr. Khan. 115. Referring to KD-15, the VDCL Board Minutes dated 12th July 2007, Mr. Saukawa said that the previous Board members were replaced by new set of Directors under the Chairmanship of Mr. Tu'uakitau. KD-16, the VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 19th July 2007 had confirmed the Minutes of 18th October 2006 Minutes. Witness said that between 18th October 2006 and 12th July 2007, there were no VDCL Board Meetings. 116. KD-17, Minutes of NLTB, PCX and VDCL dated 12th April 2007 says that Mr. Khan reiterated as the status of PCX's SAP support for NLTB and the presence of the Indian expert. Witness said that this time PCX was trying to get the system running to its former capability. It says that a total of $6.9 million cost had incurred and paid by PCX over the NLTB SAP system. Mr. Khan had told that PCX is losing $500,000 annually over the SAP deal with NLTB. It is recorded that VDCL paid $50,000 (last week) as shareholder advance to help in the situation. Finally Mr. Khan had re-iterated that "PCX's POSITION IS NOW NOT NEGOTIABLE". He had told that his financiers, Westpac and Colonial are cutting off all his credit lines and "PCX has carried the burden on behalf of NLTB which is of our own making therefore need to solve it collectively". Mr. Khan had 'demanded' a decision to be made no later than the end of that week. Mr. Saukawa recalled that the MYSAP system used by NLTB was closed down a while back. 117.

In seeking to address the current access/repayment. I have been forced to contacting KD (Director of PCX & Chairman of Vanua Mobile 9920775, email: keni.dakuidreketi@natadolafiji.com). We subsequently receive a call from Aisake Saukawa, who advised that the interest arrears would be paid by tomorrow 6/1.

" Since inception, we are aware that PacificConnex (PCX) has struggle to develop core cash flows associated with establishment of its operation, and this is evidenced via continued default in arrangements. " The company has continued to seek financing on an ad hoc basis from various sources and we estimate current borrowing to be circa $6m, majority arranged via Fiji Development Bank. " In the absence of cash flow, our principal reliance has been in respect to the cash cover provided, in support of the Guarantee provided by Vanua Development Limited (100% owned by NLTB). - The facility was extended till 31st January 2006. (ix) Exhibit No. 191- ANZ Letter to PCX dated 3rd March 2006, extending the existing Overdraft facility of $1 million until 15th March 2006, subject to the initial terms and conditions.

(xviii) Exhibit No. 215- ANZ 'Diary Note' dated 2nd July 2007, says that ANZ is to set off VDCL's Term Deposit to clear the loan of PCX. The total outstanding debt of PCX at that time was $952,203. VDCL was given the surplus of their $1 million Term Deposit after reducing this amount. 122. In cross examination, Mr. Jese agreed with Mr. Keene, QC that what they did in this instance was not a "set off" as it happens when a client has two funds, one on credit and the other on debit, they 'transfer' or 'set off' within the same client. He admitted that under the provisions of the Companies Act in Fiji, the "letter of Charge" has to be registered with the "Registrar of Companies" within 42 days. 123. Exhibit KD-19 is an email chain exchanged between this witness and a Solicitor about the 'Charge' over Term Deposit of VDCL. Referring to this, witness admitted that the 'Charge' in issue was not registered as suggested by Mr. Keene, QC, and they relied on their legal advice provided by the bank solicitors. The defence suggested that if the 'Charge is not registered as provided; it is void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company. Witness said that there was no notice provided to ANZ whether PCX was closed down from early December 2006 by military intervention. They considered PCX was still operating as the Bank communicated with the board Secretary during that time. 124. Then Mr. Jese was shown KD-20 and KD-21, two email chains exchanged between VDCL/PCX staff and the Bank. He admitted been a party to these mails and said that there was a close down of PCX and a communication breakdown in December 2006. Another set of exchanged emails between the Bank and the NLTB officials were marked through this witness as KD-22. A Diary Note dated 8th May 2007 (which the witness claimed he did not receive) was tendered as KD-23and another Diary Note, dated 15th May 2007 was marked as KD-24. Witness said that the Bank took action in terms of the Demand Notice given to PCX and ANZ kept NLTB informed of what was happening in relation to its action against VDCL and PCX. Finally he confirmed that he never spoke to Mr. KD during the course of this recovery of money process. 125. Answering questions of Mr. Blanchflower, SC, during the Re-Examination, Mr. Jese endorsed that they relied upon the legal advice provided by the Bank Solicitors in respect of the 'charge' and according to the said advice, this seems to be an 'uncertain area' of law but at that time, the bank believed that it is acting lawfully. He further confirmed that Mr. KD and Mr. Bakani signed in "Surety Acknowledgment" (Exhibit 212, page 8) with the VDCL Common Seal as the duly authorised officers of the company empowered to execute the document. 126. Referring to Exhibit 211 (Mr. KD's letter to ANZ, dated 21st December 2006), witness said that it was send two weeks after the military coup and nothing is been mentioned that PCX has ceased to operate. Pointing to ANZ letters dated 2nd January 2007 (Exhibit 212 and 213), KD-20, KD-21, KD-22 and KD-23, witness said that the Bank will not offer a loan facility of $1 million to a company that ceased to operate and there was no reference in these documents to say that PCX had closed down and ceased to operate. Prosecution Witness# 8 Mr. Ramesh Chand 127. Mr. Chand testified in relation to PCX's loan facility of $3.6 million from FDB. He recalled the request from PCX around March 2005 for a loan of $7 million. He said when assessing this request, they referred to the "Business Solution Agreement" between NLTB and PCX and obtained information regarding PCX's financial situation in 2004. Exhibit 123 is the FDB Loan Offer to PCX, dated 21st April 2005 to an amount of $3.6 million. Witness said the initially requested amount was brought down as PCX could not fulfil the requirements. Among other conditions over the loan security, witness pointed to the following. (page 2) (e) Guarantee by NLTB with the extent of annual repayments (f) First ranking assignment over contract proceeds with NLTB. (g) Joint and several guarantee by the Shareholders of the company for total liability. Witness said that one shareholder was VDCL, who held 51% of PCX shares and if PCX defaulted on FDB loan, with term (g), VDCL is liable to pay the PCX loan. 128. Exhibit 125 is the 'Guarantee', dated 26th April 2005, to FDB by NLTB, for the obligations incurred by or at the request of PCX. He agreed that NLTB Common Seal is not affixed. He said that the legal effect of this guarantee is if PCX does not pay the loan, NLTB is liable to pay FDB an amount of $3.6 million. PCX was supposed to pay $1 million in January 2006, $1.25 million in January 2007 and balance $1.35 million in January 2008. 129. Mr. Chand then referred to Exhibit 134, PCX letter to FDB, dated 11th May 2005, requesting a further advance of $3.4 million. Since there was no material change on the financial status PCX submitted earlier, witness said FDB declined this request. He recalled that PCX paid some part of this $3.6 million loan, the rest was never paid. 130. In cross examination, Mr. Chand accepted that the last payment from PCX to FDB was $108, 333 and it was on 23rd March 2007 and thereafter no payments as reflect in Exhibit KD-25.

In cross examination, Mr. Patel agreed that a corporation is a separate legal person or an entity and one part of that entity is company shareholders. He said that there must be more than one shareholder to form a company and shareholders of VDCL were three employees of NLTB. He endorsed that there is a 'capital structure' in a company to differentiate the monies of shareholders and monies came in some other ways like borrowings. He then differentiated the "authorized capital" and paid up capital", commonly known as company's equity. In case of profit or loss, he said that the equity changes, but not the paid up capital, until it is been changed by a resolution. 140. Mr. Patel identified Directors as another part of the company structure. He said that Directors either appointed by the shareholders or through the Articles of the company. Witness said that it is the Directors who run the company and make decisions for the benefit of the shareholders and in doing so they have number of obligations that they must meet. He admitted that the "management" includes the "paid staff", who gives effect to the decisions of the Board and provide information to the Board to make governance decisions as the Board governs the company. 141. Explaining what good governance is, Mr. Patel said that "generally as a Board, the Board would be responsible to ensure that the shareholders interests are protected and enhanced in terms of creating shareholders values. The Board would be responsible to ensuring the company has got business strategies and strategic directions. The Board would be responsible for monitoring the company's operations and profitability and&for risk management. In terms of governance itself there would be a code of conduct whereby the Board would be required to work within those code of conducts and best practices in those areas." 142. He said the 'Articles of Association" sets out the rules which govern the shareholders, Directors and Management. He agreed with Mr. Keene, QC, that it is a collective responsibility of the Directors to make decisions as a Board as it then becomes the decision of the company. When the requisite majority of Directors makes a decision or passes a resolution, whilst some other members abstain or dissent, it becomes Board determination. In such a situation, Mr. Patel said that the Directors are expected to do everything for the management to give effect to the Board's resolutions. Speaking on conflict or interest situations, witness said either a Director can declare the conflict, but nonetheless vote or refrain from voting. What option a Director takes depends on his own judgment. Finally, on the composition of a company, witness said that company secretary is also a 'position' in a company and he is an officer of the company, who is also bound to give effect to the resolutions as other officers. 143. Mr. Patel was then questioned on the integrity and business experience of fellow VDCL members. (i) Mr. Isoa Kaloumaira - Vastly experience banker - Competent gentleman - CEO, Fijian Trust Fund - Headed various Boards - Rate him very high of his Board skills and business accruement - Very good integrity (ii) Mr. Daniel Whippy - Accountant by profession - Executive of Carpenters Company - Very competent gentleman with vast experiences (iii) Mr. Bakani - has a Banking background - General Manger NLTB - Very experienced Executive - A man of integrity (iv) Mr. KD - Rate him very high in terms of Competence - Worked with him in various valuation exercises and with Rugby Union - Held him in very high status. Mr. Patel said that Mr. KD is an expert in the valuation area of lands and would rank him equally with the other VDCL members as far as his business experience is concerned. 144. Answering to Mr. Keene, QC, Mr. Patel said that he would make a decision on the best information available to him in a given time. He was reluctant to accept that he was more particular about certain things than his fellow members and said all the other members were just as equally particular over things. The witness agreed that had he wanted to know something about PCX as a Board member of VDCL, he could have approached anyone of three (3) VDCL members. He further agreed that VDCL owned class 'A' shares in PCX, which had a first right to dividend attaching term and the different classes of shares have different rights. 145. Then the witness was taken through the following exhibits. (i) Exhibit No. 14 - (6) Other Matters. "Kalivati Bakani to ensure that a declaration was executed by the current shareholders confirming that they held the shares in trust for NLTB". - Witness said that such a declaration of the trust in favor of NLTB would imply that the shares belong to NLTB. - Agreed that shareholders cannot control the assets of a company, but, it is the Board. - Appendix 1 (NLTB Board Meeting Minutes dated 18th December 2003) - Referring to FAB approval (4), witness said that the transfer of Trust Funds money was intended to be the capital of VDCL whether the paid-up capital of $7.7. million, cash or assets, and trust money or NLTB's own funds, according to Mr. Patel, the money is capitalized or its been transferred for the purpose of capitalization and it becomes an issue for the VDCL Board rather than NLTB, as at that point it is been converted into equity and where it came from would not a matter.

(vi) Exhibit 45 - A capital grant of $747,338, instead of $1 million received by VDCL. - Witness confirmed getting a 9% interest for the 1st PCX loan of $2 million is a sufficient overall return.

In re-examination Mr. Patel said that even though a collective responsibility is there among the Board members, if the majority of the Board passed a resolution that was outside the objects of a company or causes the company to do any illegal act, dissenting Board members need not to carry out the resolution into effect. Mr. Patel went on to say a Board member of integrity will ensure that his fellow members are informed of all true and complete facts and will not suppress the material information. Therefore, he told court that he thought the 3 VDCL Board members who sat in PCX Board would inform him any material information required for his decisions. 147. Mr. Patel's position on the following exhibits was then clarified by prosecution. (i) Exhibit 14 - Witness said that he was not provided with any of the NLTB Board Minutes, relating to NLTB Trust Funds over the establishment of VDCL. (ii) Exhibit 170 - Referring to Exhibits 171 (VDCL Board Minutes 21st October 2005) Exhibit 185 (VDCL Board Minutes 15th February 2006), Exhibit 196 (VDCL Board Minutes 12th April 2006), Exhibit 246 (VDCL Board Minutes 16th August 2006) Mr. Patel said that no Director expressed a view or surprise as to how PWC treated the capital in the VDCL audited accounts. He said he was not shown the contract between PCX and PCMS, but he knew that PCX and TUI Consulting were owned by Mr. Ballu Khan. (iii) Exhibit KD-30(A)- Mr. Patel agreed with the prosecution that the letter dated 9th May 2006 to PCX by the Minister says, PCX has satisfied the government requirements, ownership by Fijian citizens and shareholding strength. He admitted that Mr. Bakani's letter to the Ministry of Information dated 12th May, 2006 appears like a complaint with strong allegation against the cabinet and the Government.Mr. Patel quoted from his letter, that PCXhad to wait to get 12 months to get a reply to its application, whereas DIGICEL'S got theirs within 1 day. (iv) Exhibit No. 189 - Mr. Patel agreed that the auditors are relying on the accuracy and the completeness of the information they receive from the board of Directors and the management in preparation of the financial statements and this PCX financial statement was produced in February 2006, after 14 months of the relevant period. 148. Revisiting the question of the public announcement made in the wake of Political events in 2006 that VDCL will be closed down, Mr. Patel said it would not be proper for a company to be a guarantor to guarantee a loan on behalf of a Third Party with a bank if the guarantor believed that the company is going to close down. Prosecution Witness # 11 Mr. Daniel Whippy 149. Mr. Whippy started his evidence saying sometime in December 2003 he was approached by Mr. Bakani to be a Board member of VDCL, a government owned company that they were going to form to operate like Fijian Holdings and invest in blue chip companies. He said that VDCL was a fully owned subsidiary of NLTB and there were some Extinct Mataqali funds that they wanted to invest in various investments in Fiji to reap high returns. He confirmed Exhibit 12, his letter of appointment to VDCL dated 23rd December 2003. He told that Mr. KD was the Chairman of the board and his role was to lead board minutes, ensure the discussions on the papers by each board member and take opinions from each member. He claimed that he knew Mr. KD in the business circles in Fiji and contracted Mr. KD's valuation company, ROLLE Valuations in his business dealings for around 20 years. He went on to say that Mr. KD was also a former Minister for Sports, Chairman of Fiji Rugby Union, member of the NLTB Board and got involved in Natadola Hotel Development Project with FNPF. 150. Referring to Mr. Bakani, another VDCL Board member, Mr. Whippy said that he was the Deputy Head of the National Bank of Fiji and later joined Carpenters as a Deputy Managing Director and General Manager for NLTB. Mr. Kaloumaira, according to Mr. Whippy, was mostly very quiet during the board meetings and would agree to approving of the loans in agreement with Mr. KD and Mr. Bakani. 151. Whilst citing paragraph 2of the VDCL MOA (Exhibit 3), Mr. Whippy said that he understood the purpose of VDCL to be the commercial vehicle of NLTB as trustee for the Fijian land owners as stipulated under NLTA Cap 134. "ACKNOWLEDGING AND RESPECTING FIJIAN CULTURE, CUSTOMS AND TRADIONS, the prime object for which the Company is established is to engage in the facilitation of the investment of native land in Fiji for projects, businesses and enterprises and, in support of this object, to facilitate the investment of income trust, development, erection, construction, management and/or operation of projects, businesses and enterprises, to be pursued singularly and/or in partnership or in joint venture with, and/or for and on behalf of individuals, partnerships, other companies and/or other entities, either as partners consultants, advisors, managers, agents, brokers or otherwise and in this regard and without limiting the generality thereof the Company shall either singularly or otherwise. Establish the broad planning guidelines and parameters consistent with the development philosophy of the Company. Explore the possibility of establishing banking and credit facilities for landowners. Do all and any other things for the benefit of the commercial development of native lands in Fiji for related projects, businesses and enterprises and/or the ownership and/or management of related projects, businesses and enterprises. Do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the Company's objects and the exercise of the powers of the Company, or which may be done conveniently in connection therewith, or which may be calculated directly or indirectly to enhance the value of or render profitable the whole or any part of the undertaking, assets and the businesses of the Company." 152. Then Mr. Whippy spoke about PCX. He said, he became aware of PC X as a vehicle for providing computer services to NLTB and its owner Mr. Ballu Khan had offered 51% shares to VDCL as a gift. He recalled asking Mr. Bakani what is Mr. Kahn's "catch" with this gift, to which Mr. Bakani replied that there is no catch but Mr. Khan wants to help the Fijians. Then, Tui Consulting, according to Mr. Whippy was a management services company fully owned by Mr. Ballu Khan. Mr. Whippy could not recall showing him any agreement between NLTB and PCX or PCX and PCMX. 153. Referring to Exhibit 21 (reproduced in paragraph 134 (2)of this chapter), Mr. Whippy said, that 3 VDCL members were appointed as members of PCX. From those members he expected to inform him any important information on PCX's finances, give copies of minutes of discussions of PCX and specifically the funding issues faced at PCX. He continued with Exhibit 38, the $2million loan proposal from PCX and said the fact that Mr. Ballu Khan on behalf of PCX had promised NLTB to pay $4.6 million upfront cost for the implementation of NLTB's computer system, would have been a matter of importance to take his decision on this loan request and the VDCL board should have been informed of it. 154. Then Mr. Whippy was taken through the following exhibits. (i) Exhibit No. 43 - VDCL Extraordinary Board Meeting Minutes on 1st June, 2004 (refer to paragraph 135 (3)) - He said that there was a "trusteeship requirement" with regards to the investment of funds as VDCL was responsible to follow and be consistent with NLTB's trust guidelines. - He further clarified that when making investments VDCL first have to be consistent with VDCL's Investment Policy and secondly with NLTB's policy on investments. (ii) Exhibit No. 46 - VDCL Investment Policy (refer to paragraph 65). 155. The next topic discussed with Mr. Whippy was the $900,000 loan to PCX. (i) Exhibit No. 79 - VDCL Internal Memo PCX Loan Proposal (refer to paragraph 80 (2) - Mr. KD, Mr. Bakani and Mr. Kaloumaira supported - Witness said that since three members had already agreed, he thought not to comment as there would be no point in doing so. (ii) Exhibit No. 83 - E-mail chain between Mr. Saukawa and Mr. Whippy (Refer to paragraph 80 (3) of this chapter. - Witness said that he asked for the financial statements of PCX to understand how their business was performing, as he did not receive those, despite several requests by himself and Mr. Patel. (iii) Exhibit No. 112 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 16th March 2005 - Witness was absent - Investment of $1m Government grant in Dominion Finance. (Refer to paragraph82 (v) of this chapter) (iv) Exhibit No. 116 - VDCL Board Papers for 13th April 2005 - Board Paper 003/2005 - Letter of FDB, dated 11th April 2005, approving PCX a loan of $4.6 million. - Refinancing $1m Dominion Finance loan was one purpose. - Security (d) Joint and several guarantee by the shareholders (inclusive VDCL) of the company for total liability. - Witness said that he was concerned about this move as VDCL had invested a lot of money in PCX and it was not performing as expected. (v) Exhibit No. 117 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 13th April 2005. (Refer to paragraph 86 (2) of this chapter) - Witness said though the Board approved the FDB Guarantee, he would not have agreed to that. - With this guarantee, witness said that FDB will get the first priority over VDCL and in case PCX breached their loan conditions or defaulted the loan, that would affect the first two VDCL loans given to PCX. (vi) Exhibit No. 135 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 11th May 2005. - VDCL Guarantee over PCX loan from FDB.(refer to paragraph 86 (viii)in this chapter) - Concerns were raised over providing guarantees without prior Board Approvals. (vii) Exhibit No. 138 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 15th May 2005 - Draft accounts to be obtained for the Directors to discuss FDB guarantee. - Witness said he made this request to understand how PCX was performing financially. Up until June 2005, he said that he was not provided the financial statements. (viii) Exhibit No. 143 - VDCL Board Papers for 13th July 2005 - Board Paper NO. 005/2005 Proposal to Guarantee PCX Facility with Credit Corporation for $350,000. - Refer to paragraph 88 (iv) of this chapter) - Witness said that this made him concerned as by then the VDCL exposure in PCX was 91.46% whilst the guideline was 20%. (ix) Exhibit No. 144 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 13th July 2005 - Credit Corporation Guarantee Directors wanted to see the comprehensive Report of Mr. Bakani prepared for NLTB. (Refer to paragraph 88 (v)of this chapter) - Witness said the reason for his concerns was that he was not informed about the financial performances, yet they were approving several loans and guarantees to PCX. (x) Exhibit No. 148 - Mr. Whippy's letter to Mr. KD, dated 9th August 2005 and e-mail chain with Mr. Saukawa. - E-mails are reproduced in paragraph 87 (v) of this chapter. - Following are some excerpts of his letter. "In PCX's first year of operation the loss is incredible which cast doubts about our ability to recognize opportunities and manage investments. What corrective measures, if any, are being suggested? What are the goals of PCX? Are these achievable? What are we doing about it? More importantly, if we continuously do not question on-going requests for additional borrowings in relation to achieving realistic objectives, the integrity of the Board will be brought into question. The credentials of our Board is impeccable and it will certainly be embarrassing to see this tainted. It is a possibility that external auditors may question the viability of PCX as a going concern in view of unfavourable debt ratios and the extent of its borrowings. At its present rate assuming that the level of income and expenditure does not change, this could become a likely event. What is our contingency plan if this becomes real? Normally 70% debt and 30% equity is industry average but depending on market value of assets, 1 to 1 is the highest any lender would lent at. If PCX needs cash the shareholders should contribute more capital instead of borrowing. If Tui Consulting believes in this business then they must put the money in. We still have not received PCX reports compiled by NLTB for the NLTB Board meeting last month despite the assurance by the Board it would be circulated. Further all loan documents that have been entered into was also supposed to be circulated and this still has not been done yet. Given the exposure by PCX clearly the board of VDCL must be concerned given that the priority over income have been given to some other institution." - Witness said he expressed his concern that VDCL should not be lending or guaranteeing any loans for PCX because its viability was a growing concern. - Witness confirmed that he was not an approving member of VDCL guarantee to ANZ, as it was approved by 3 Directors. - Witness said that VDCL's poor investment decisions will change its Balance Sheet dramatically and it would have reflected in NLTB as well. - Mr. Whippy confirmed that Mr. KD did not respond to his concerns he expressed. (xi) Exhibit No. 151 - Mr. Bakani's Internal Memo, dated 10th August 2005, responding to Mr. Whippy. - Mr. Bakani had asked to have faith in their counterparts representing VDCL in PCX. - Witness recalled that he received this memo during the scheduled VDCL Board meeting for the day. He said that he was surprised over Mr. Bakani's position, but then that was his position. (xii) Exhibit No. 150 - VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 10th August 2005. - Formalising the variation of VDCL guarantee with ANZ. - Witness said that he would have disagreed withthis decision, as this decision was taken after he sent his letter (Exhibit 148) to Mr. KD. (xiii) Exhibit No. 159 - VDCL Board Minutes dated 28th September 2005. - Board Paper No. 014/2005 PCX loan proposal for $1 million. - Directors agreed to lend the amount to PCX to pay their debt with Vinod Patel. (refer to paragraph 89 (ii) of this chapter) - Witness said that he would have agreed with the other Directors to lend $1m to PCX because $900,000 will come back from Vinod Patel to PCX. - He went on to say that he was not aware that under the PCX loan with FDB for $3.6m, since April 2005, NLTB's annual payment to PCX went directly to FDB and that would have been an important factor for him to know when making business decisions. (xiv) Exhibit No. 170 - Board Paper 14/2005. PCX Financial Statements for 2004. - Witness claimed that it was the first time he saw a draft PCX financial statement. (xv) Exhibit No. 179 - VDCL Internal Memo PCX's request for $100,000 to pay their legal fees. - Mr. KD and Mr. Bakani approved the request whilst Mr. Patel and Mr. Kaloumaira deferred their decisions for want of further information. - Mr. Whippy's response dated 20th January 2006 is as follows: "All cash advances, borrowings and guarantees should not be provided until PCX can demonstrate the following: (i) PCX is a profitable business and able to generate positive cash flows on existing business assignments. (ii) PCX provide audited financial statements for 2004. (iii) PCX provide financial statements for 2005 plus minutes of Board Meetings. (iv) Are other shareholders providing similar advances." (xvi) Exhibit No. 194 - Mr. Kaloumaira had given his approval on 7th of April 2006 for the above request. 156. Finally, Mr. Whippy said, that there was a time that he wished to resign from the VDCL Board, after his memo to Mr. KD as he was concerned at the level of PCX borrowings and could not understand the mindset of its principal owner. He said he knew from the market place that Mr. Ballu Khan was very extravagant in his spending and he suspected that the monies so used were going from PCX. But Mr. Whippy said that the Directors did not seem so and he did not want to get up in this mess. Mr. Whippy had decided to continue in VDCL after Mr. Patel told him that they should remain as independent members and the Prime Minister wanted them to stay. 157. Then Mr. Whippy was cross examined. Referring to VDCL's Memorandum of Association witness agreed that VDCL's objects included "market, promote, and advertise the company's development of land in Fiji, for related project, businesses and enterprises and raise secure money, finance, debt, equity and or capital" (para 2 (xii, viii). Next he was referred to para xx) Invest and deal with the monies of the Company not immediately required upon such securities and investments including government loans, shares in, or securities of other companies or deposits with any bank, financial institution, company, firm or individual at interest and to vary from time to time such investments and generally in such matter as may from time to time be determined by the Directors. 158. Witness agreed that the objectives of VDCL are very broad and did not restrict the board in decision making. He further agreed that the investments in PCX by VDCL would not qualify as a blue chip investment as he thought. As Exhibit 21 reflects, VDCL board meeting minutes 11th February, 2004 (refer to paragraph 134(ii) witness confirmed that he voted to approve the PCX offer for a joint venture partnership in principal. 159. When the first loan request from PCX for $2m came up to VDCL, Mr. Whippy admitted that it contained the IT solution agreement between NLTB and PCX and he studied the said agreement as his commercial justification is based on that. He considered that he voted in favor of this loan request and in fact signed the Deed of Assignment (KD-14)on behalf of VDCL as the other Directors were not available. The signing process was extended by the witness saying that the signing of documents in VDCL was done by whoever available at a particular time. 160. Talking on the VDCL Investment Policy Guidelines, Mr. Whippy said the maximum investment limit of 20% was a decision approved by the board and the board could have varied the guidelines and review periodically. When the $2m loan was lent to PCX, VDCL guidelines had not been adopted. Mr. Whippy agreed that this $2m loan to PCX breached the 20% exposure guideline, and said the point of setting up VDCL is to have more freedom to invest funds than NLTB enjoyed. 161. The next topic where Mr. Whippy was cross-examined was the $900,000 loan. The statement Mr. Whippy made to FICAC was shown to him by the defence to clarify the non-availability of his comments in Exhibit 79. Mr. Whippy said that it happened a long time back and he might have received this internal memo but may have not commented because others have already made their comments. He agreed that it follows that he cannot say differently whether he voted for the request or voted against the request. 162. On the issue of placement of the Government grant of $1m with Dominion Finance, Mr. Whippy confirmed that it was the VDCL Board view that the best return came from Dominion Finance and that was what he would have been expected to happen with that money. 163. The next topic questioned was the VDCL guarantee to FDB for $3.6m PCX loan. Mr. Whippy admitted that the VDCL Board resolved to guarantee the PCX loan facility but could not recall either the discussions of the Board meeting or whether he voted for or against the resolution. He went on to say that he had concerns about this FDB guarantee but it was later and not at the time and therefore, he did not express his concerns at the relevant time. 164. Pointing to VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 11th May 2005, (Exhibit 135) VDCL Guarantee over PCX Loan form FDB, Mr. Whippy said that there was a prior Board approval to the FDB guarantee and the issue in this Board Meeting was raised by Mr. Patel. 165. On ANZ Term Deposit of VDCL, Mr. Whippy agreed that even though he emailed to Mr. Saukawa that he was not aware of VDCL's guarantee/security to ANZ for PCX loan, according to Exhibit KD-13, he had received an email from Mr. Saukawa that both VDCL Term Deposit and PCX loan be shifted to ANZ for a better interest rate. 166. Witness said the purpose amongst other things of his letter to Mr. KD, dated 9th August 2005 (Exhibit 148) is to clear up the transactions related to Vinod Patel and Credit Corporation. Mr. Whippy was satisfied that Mr. KD had taken steps to circulate his letter immediately after he received the same on 10th of August 2005 and the result was Mr. Bakani's Memo dated 12th August, 2005. 167. Mr. Whippy recalled that, Mr. Ballu Khan approached Carpenters Fiji for the implementation of MYSAP IT system and in fact did a good presentation as well, but he said the quoted cost was far beyond their budget, so he said that he "took that as he is pitching for business and setting his goals up there and got the Board thinking like that. So everybody is just being sort of strung along. I wanted to understand what the strategies were but I didn't get any feedback". 168. The witness was questioned that PCX had to spend at least $4.8m by end of December 2004 to put the NLTB MYSAP system into place and would not get any revenue at all until its first payment from NLTB from January 2005. While agreeing with this Mr. Whippy said that the PCX operating expenditure was quiet high and that was his concern. Defence suggestion that he should not be surprised or disappointed at a $1.4m loss to PCX in the first year of a startup project as it would be better in time to come, Mr. Whippy said that he would expect losses but not to that tune. But, at one point Mr. Whippy conceded that the catastrophe in profitability figures of PCX comes when compared to a business in ordinary operation but not a startup company. 169. Witness agreed that though Mr. Patel was of the view that VDCL and PCX financial statements should be consolidated, the auditors, PWC, said that the consolidation can't be done because VDCL does not have the management control of PCX (Exhibit 206). 170. Then Mr. Whippy had to admit that as in the Dominion Finance facility, he cannot recall whether he voted for or against the resolution in relation to the extension of the term deposit with ANZ bank. 171. Mr. Whippy concurred with Mr. Keene, QC, that once he sent his letter to Mr. KD, he was satisfied that he said whatever he wanted to say and made aware to the Board about his concerns. 172. Referring to Exhibit 159, VDCL Board Papers for 28th September 2005, witness agreed that there were expectations of financial arrangements for PCX, but because Vinod Patel was not paying it, PCX was in critical financial situation (Refer to paragraph 89 (ii)of this chapter). 173. Mr. Whippy produced Exhibit KD - 31, VDCL Board Meeting Minutes dated 18th October 2006. By that time it was finalized that the accounts of PCX for 2004 and 2005 will not be consolidated with VDCL accounts. Directors resolved the following on draft 2005 audited accounts "Draft 2005 Audited Accounts [PB No. 018/06] Chairman took the Board through the draft 2005 accounts. Director NP raised the issue of the income recognition whereby all income is to be booked first at VDCL level. The issue of dividing the income into NLTB Trust, Finance and the poundage will need to be addressed after the income is recognized. The auditors are to be advised to incorporate these changes. Directors resolved the finalizing of the non-consolidated 2004 & 2005 accounts subject to the changes as mentioned." 174. Citing Exhibit KD 16 Mr. Whippy said the VDCL Board Meeting dated 19th July 2007 had confirmed the last meeting minutes, which was Exhibit KD - 31. Mr. Whippy said that he ceased to become a Director of VDCL by a written notification dated 30th June 2007 from the Ministry of Fijian Affairs that he was been replaced with effect from 25th June, 2007. He recalled that there was a public announcement after their last VDCL Board Meeting that VDCL is going to be continued or not and after the said letter he was not communicated on any further replacement or removal of his Directorship in VDCL. He said that his recollection was that "term is expired. You finished. Gone. You might get a letter or don't get a letter, but that's how I saw it. I assume I had completed my term." Exhibit KD 32, letter to Mr. Whippy from the Interim Minister for Fijian Affairs Board to the effect that his Directorship in VDCL is replaced by the interim board was marked as KD 32. 175. Finally, in re- examination, Mr. Whippy agreed with the mathematical calculation of the defence about $47625 inExhibit 189, the PCX audited financial statements and said that amount was not due on 31st of December 2005 to VDCL but rather payable. 176. The prosecution sought certain clarifications from Mr. Whippy in re-examination. (i) Exhibit No. 14 - Witness said his understanding as to the principal activities of VDCL was to invest and investment management of trust funds. (ii) Exhibit No. 79 - He said that in the normal course had he voted for the $900,000 PCX loan proposal, he would have endorsed it in writing, here it shows a blank under his name. (iii) Exhibit No. 144 - VDCL guarantee over PCX facility with Credit Corporation was deferred until the Directors have a look at the comprehensive report of Mr. Bakani to be submitted to NLTB but not declined. Mr. Whippy clarified his answer in cross examination "at a later date" saying that it was a time when this matter was still being before the Board. (iv) Exhibit 148 - Witness recalled that when he wrote this letter to Mr. KD in August 2005 which was circulated among other members, nobody said to him that his calculations were wrong. (v) Exhibit No. 206 - Witness confirmed that by August 2006 the topic of consolidation of VDCL and PCX accounts was not a discussed issue. (vi) Exhibit KD 31 - Witness said that on the proposal on Yatu Lau Capital Raising the Board resolved to acknowledge the proposal and to advice the Issue Manager that VDCL is not in a position to participate in this investment at the moment over to the unavailability of the surplus funds as all funds are committed at the moment. - Mr. Whippy confirmed that at the time of this meeting October 2006, VDCL had lent a total of $3.9m of loans to PCX and tied up $1m in a term deposit with ANZ as security for PCX overdraft facility. 177. Finally, Mr. Whippy noted that Exhibit KD 32, the letter informed him about his replacement in VDCL was not only to him but for all 5 members of the VDCL Board and the public announcement over the continuation of VDCL came after the military coup of 6th December, 2006.

Mr. Ram was cross examined onExhibit KD 33, 33.1, 33.2, 33.3. (i) KD 33 - No. 9 refers to KD.1 and KD 33.2, the Particulars of Mortgage or Charge of VDCL made out to Colonial Fiji Life Limited. - Witness confirmed that it is the only charge mentioned in KD-33, documents been received by Registrar of Companies on VDCL. - No. 23 refers to KD 33.3, Voluntary winding Up of VDCL. 180. In re-examination, Mr. Ram, referring to KD 33-3, Liquidators Statement of account, said that it is a document dated 5th April 2013 as oppose to KD 33 .2, Deed of Charge is dated 22nd of November 2005. 181. The end of Mr. Ram's evidence, marked the end of prosecution list of witnesses as well. Nevertheless, you would recall that the prosecution with the agreement of the defense read out eight statements of the witnesses and three Banker's Affidavits. You are provided with the copies of those statements. Thus, I see no purpose of reproducing the contents of those exhibits as I am pretty much sure you have already gone through them. 182. After the prosecution declared of closing their case, you witnessed the court decided to call for the defence from the accused. He opted to remain silent without calling any witnesses on his behalf to testify. I have already told you that to remain silent is his right. ANALYSIS OF LAW AND FACTS 1. I have already mentioned to you briefly in Chapter IV "Elements of the Offence", what elements are contained in the offence of "Abuse of Office". Now you have to see whether the evidence led by the prosecution in relation to each element of each count proves the five (5) separate counts beyond reasonable doubt or for you to be sure of the guilt of the accused. First, I will direct you on the legal background of the elements of the offences. You will have to accept and act upon those directions. 2. The 1st element is whether the accused was employed in the "Public Service" or not. This with the agreement of both counsel, I consider as a pure question of law. Thus, I relieve you from deliberating this issue. After having considered the following exhibits and legal provisions, which I am going to elaborate more descriptively in my judgment, (i) Section 111 of the Penal Code; (ii) Section 04 of the Penal Code; (iii) Public Service Act (iv) Exhibit 1 Mr. KD's first appointment to NLTB from 2001 2004 (v) Exhibit 252 (i) to (vi) Mr. KD's reappointment to NLTB from 2004 2007; (vi) Exhibit 09 Mr. KD's appointment of Mr. KD to Chairman VDCL by NLTB; (vii) Exhibit 12 Letter of Appointment of Mr. KD to Chairman VDCL by NLTB; (viii) Exhibit KD 32 Letter dated 25th June 2007 from Interim Affairs Minister for Fijian Affairs to Mr. KD; (ix) Exhibit 4 Articles of Association of VDCL, Articles 72,73,75,93 and 97; (x) Exhibit 6, 6A, 6B,6C Particulars of Directors and Secretary of VDCL and; (xi) Section 182 of the Companies Act. I direct you that the accused, Mr. KD, was "a person employed in the public service" at all material times to the charges. The remaining elements, of course depend on the facts that you have to deliberate. But, to do so, you have to adopt the legal background now I am going to tell you. 3. The 2nd element is "did an arbitrary act". The term "Arbitrary Act" is an act of omission or commission of one's own free will without been guided by the rules and regulations, but by his own whims and fancies. Here, in the five charges (5) against the accused, 'arbitrary act' denotes to 'facilitation' of loans to PCX, either directly from VDCL or through Dominion Finance and ANZ. The word 'facilitate', as the word speaks for itself, means to make the commission of something easier. 4. (i) The next element is whether 'arbitrary act defined above, was done in abuseof the authority of the office the accused held. When a person actsunder the colour of his 'office' or 'position' for some illegitimate agenda without a proper or reasonable justification, either with the intention of causing loss or harm to another or conferring some advantage or benefit to another, is said to have acted in abuse of the authority of his office. In such a situation, irrespective of the final outcome, he is acting in a "bad faith" or with a "improper motive". A mere act of 'negligence' would not suffice to justify a charge of "Abuse of Office". (ii) Therefore, it is essential to find out or satisfied whether the accused possessed any "improper motive" at the material times of the charges. None of us would be able to say what exactly went through the accused's mind during that time. But, you can consider all the direct and circumstantial evidence led before you, through oral and documentary evidence, to have your conclusions about his motives and state of mind. This is where you have to follow the direction given on circumstantial evidence. This conclusion will answer whether the accused abused the authority of his office or not. 5. The next element is whether the 'act' in issue is prejudicial to the rights of another, here in this case, to NLTB and Indigenous Fijians. A 'misconduct by partiality', such as favouring friends, family members, relatives or even total outsiders and corporates could prejudice the rights of other concerned persons. These 'rights', need not only be 'Constitutional rights' or 'legally defined rights'. It is simply used in 'generic terms' and it is sufficient to prove that any general right of NLTB or Indigenous Fijians is been prejudiced. 6. Finally, the element of 'gain'. Prosecution alleges that the 'arbitrary' acts they claim were done by the accused were for the purpose of gain. The gain is an increase of something in amount, degree or value. It can be in different types, may be financial or political or some other thing depending on the circumstances. The beneficiary could be the accused himself or a family member, a friend, a total outsider or a business entity. The benefit could be direct or indirect. 7. Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, It is needless to say that this trial is against Mr. KD. The five charges you concentrated throughout the proceedings focus only this accused. Therefore, it is not open for you to speculate the involvement or contribution of the others to the alleged circumstances. The issue before you is to deliberate whether Mr. KD committed the alleged offences as charged. The issue before you is whether the prosecution managed to prove to your fullest satisfaction all the elements of charges against Mr. KD. I direct you that it is not your concern whom to be charged or who else to be charged. Your concern should be on the law, elements of the charges, the evidence you witnessed and the accused. 8. In respect of Count No. 8, VDCL Term Deposit of $1 million in ANZ, defence argued that there was no prejudice to Indigenous Fijians as ANZ taking of VDCL's $1 million was illegal without a 'valid charge' and ANZ could be required to pay the money to the liquidators. Defence argument arose in a context where the 'charge' over VDCL's Term Deposit kept as a security to PCX overdraft and loan facilities was not registered at the Registrar of Companies within the required time of 42 days and when executed it is been expired on 1st of August 2005. By proper process, they said that the money would have been recovered into VDCL and back to government. As a matter of law I am directing you that in terms of section 98 of the Companies Act, a 'Charge' is void unless the prescribed particulars of charge been registered with Registrar of Companies within 42 days of its creation. The prosecution said that ANZ had the 'Guarantee' of VDCL's $1 million Term Deposit apart from this 'Charge' and the bank legal advisor was not certain whether the Charge to be registered or not. They argued that the Term Deposit was enforced 2 years later and the failure of ANZ to register the Charge over Term Deposit does not affect the accused's approval to provide such security. According to the prosecution, it is crucial that neither the accused nor the VDCL made any complaints about the enforcement. The law and facts relevant to your opinion are made available to you now. You can now decide whether there could be no prejudice, as defence suggested to NLTB and Indigenous Fijians, if the proposed cause of action over the 'Charge' was taken. 9. Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, I hope that the closing Addresses of the counsel are still fresh in your minds. I paid more attention to the evidence tendered to court by the parties as it was somewhat complicated with the number of documents involved and the length of the period the trial continued. I am confident that with the detailed summary of evidence, you would recall what exactly took place in court for the last six weeks. Now your task is to apply the law as I directed to you and deliberate the facts to see whether or not the prosecution is successful in proving the charges against Mr. KD. 10. I do not intend to talk much about the arguments raised by the counsel during their closing address. Both the counsel, as you know, took one full day each for their oral submissions, with copies to you as well, which contained their arguments in full. If I am to analyse those arguments which run over 200 odd pages, you will surely get exhausted. That is why I provided you the opportunity (on 30th August 2014) to go through the respective written submissions and exhibits once more for you to be more conversant and familiar with the arguments of the parties. I warned you to maintain an open mind until my summing up, as without the applicable legal principles, you should not come into conclusions. Now you are fully equipped to formulate your opinions. 11. In a nutshell, the case of the prosecution is that the accused being a Director of NLTB, the Chairman of VDCL and a Director of PCX had a duty to report back to NLTB Directors about all VDCL investments and contracts and the affairs of PCX and its financial issues. At the same time, being the Chairman of VDCL, he had the same duty towards VDCL Board to inform other Board members, at least Mr. Patel and Mr. Whippy about the PCX's operations and financial situations as they expected him to provide true and complete information to take their Board decisions. Prosecution claims that the accused, whilst knowing 'PCX's financial situation, like loans and revenue, as those were regular topics discussed at PCX Board meetings, did not provide those information, either to NLTB or VDCL. The result of the acts of Mr. KD, according to the prosecution was a gain to PCX in various financial capacities and in return, prejudiced the rights of the NLTB and Indigenous Fijians. They argued that this case is not about what Mr. KD said to NLTB and VDCL, but what he did not tell. 12. For each count, prosecution points out to certain acts alleged to have done by the accused to facilitate the loans and securities to PCX. Most of those acts if not all, were not disputed by the defence. They elaborated, according to their case theory, how the accused abused the authority of his office and secured a gain to PCX causing prejudice to NLTB and Indigenous Fijians. For instance the 1st count, prosecution argues that when Mr. Ballu Khan promised the NLTB Board on 12th March 2004 that PCX would bear the NLTB MySAP upfront cost, the accused was present at that meeting and while knowing this undertaking, he did not disclose this undertaking either to VDCL when $2 million loan proposal was made and approved between March to July 2004 or to NLTB about the loan request, its nature, VDCL approval and NLTB's proceeds been assigned to VDCL as security. 13. The written submission of the prosecution provides you all the evidence that they rely on, with reference to the relevant exhibits, in respect of each element of each count. Now it is left to you madam assessor and gentlemen assessors to decide whether the contention put forward by the prosecution in respect of all five charges against the accused is to be accepted or not. 14. The defence in contrary, argued that you are not being asked about whether you agree or disagree with the decisions of NLTB or VDCL Boards nor the actions of Mr. KD. They say the issue there is not about the wiseness or foolishness of those decisions or acts, but whether Mr. KD honestly believed what he did was for right reasons and whether he had a bad or improper motive when doing so. The defence answer to these questions is 'no'. It was said to you that a mere mistake, even a serious one or a failure is not enough to say that Mr. KD acted with an improper motive. Defence continued to argue that as long as the Board believed what it decided to spend the money will be of benefit to Ingenious Fijians, that is enough. It was pointed out that if they buy a building as a recreation centre and later on find the building has to be demolished, that does mean the decision to buy the building was wrong. The conclusion is that they believed they were doing something that would be beneficial to the concerned parties, but it turned out to be a bad decision. Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, you can now weight both contentions of the prosecution and the defence and decide whether the acts of Mr. KD were done with any improper motive in abuse of authority of his office in arbitrary manner or not. 15. The decisions made by Mr. KD as the Chairman of VDCL Board, according to the defence, were not individual. Even the last $1 million loan requested by PCX was approved by the entire VDCL Board, as they saw PCX as still a live business opportunity. They argued that those decisions are rational business and investment decisions made by a Board which is empowered to make those decisions. Further, it was said that those were not 'arbitrary acts' emerged from his whims and fancies, but done after following good process. 16. Then the defence pointed out that none of the gains alleged by the prosecution is not of personal gain to Mr. KD or anyone associated with him, such as family member or business venture with interests, but for PCX. They questioned as to why Mr. KD would want to act criminally for the purpose of granting a gain to a business in which he had no financial interest. Defence said that it is even more curious as the gain claimed by the prosecution is to a business which is majority owned by VDCL. As you know by now, 'gain' is a distinct element in all five charges. It is your task now to decide whether the prosecution has proved this element beyond reasonable doubt or not. 17. A considerable amount of attention was drawn by the defence through certain witnesses about the military coup alleged to have taken place on 6th December 2006. It was argued by the defence that the said military intervention which demanded the close down of VDCL and carried out raids on PCX, caused PCX to be unable to repay its debts out of the funds going to be generated from its business. Further they said that with this political development, NLTB ceased to pay their dues to PCX and it aggravated the background. But, the prosecution argued that it is not relevant to this instance as the granting of loans or securing bank facilities to PCX took place in 2004 and 2005. The three loans given to PCX by VDCL were due before the so called 'military intervention', the prosecution argued. They went on to say, apart from two weeks (2) where ANZ could not contact anyone in PCX office, nothing showed that PCX seized its operations indefinitely and in fact Mr. KD's letter to ANZ dated 21st December 2006, does not indicate anything of PCX ceasing its operations. You can now assess both sides of this argument and decide what you are going to accept and relied upon. 18. During the closing submissions, defence raised concerns of FICAC placed selected evidence before court with the intention of winning the case. They questioned the reason for them to produce 33 extremely material documents, whilst prosecution tendered over 250 documents, and asked why those could not be produced by the prosecution itself. The argument was extended to say that some of the witness like Mr. Kaloumaira, a VDCL director, Mr. Kolinio Boila or Price Waterhouse Coppers Auditors were not called to share the great deal of knowledge they had over the contested issues. In the same vein, defence raised issues about the credibility of Mr. Tabuatamata and Mr. Whippy. 19. As a matter of law, I am directing you that as much as the defence is allowed to criticise the strategy of the prosecution, the prosecution has a right to decide what witnesses are to be called and documents to be produced. But, the prosecution has a continuing duty to disclose all the material to the defence, whether favourable or not for their case. There is no allegation of prosecution not doing so. At the same time, you would recall that the accused was given an opportunity to call any witness on his behalf. Had he wanted to call any witness, he would have done so. Therefore, the matter rests with the quality, not the quantity of evidence. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the credibility and truthfulness of the witness and documents, matter ends there. But, if not, the benefit of such doubts should benefit the accused. 7. SUMMARY (i) I remind you once again that the accused need not to prove anything to show his innocence. The prosecution must prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt or to your fullest satisfaction over the guilt of the accused. If you have any reasonable doubt on the case of prosecution, you have to find the accused 'NOT GUILTY' to five charges. (ii) Finally, I recall the instruction I gave you in my opening address. I hope you approached this case with an open mind. The accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. Thus, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt or for sure that the prosecution has proved its case, you must find the accused guilty to all the charges. If you are not sure of the guilt of the accused after having analysed the evidence of the prosecution, you must find him 'NOT GUILTY' to all five charges. Charges are based on totally independent incidents and you can conclude differently. (iii) You are aware that Count 1 is Abuse of Office for the purpose of gain. I have directed you on what abuse of office is and also what for the purpose of gain is. If you think that he has abused the authority of his office, and for the purpose of gain that you will find him guilty as charged. However, it is nevertheless open to you to find that he has abused the authority of his office, but not for the purposes of gain in which case you will find him not guilty as charged but guilty of the alternative charge or guilty of abuse of office. If you think that he has not abused his office, then gain is not relevant and you will find him not guilty. When you are asked your opinion of this charge you will say guilty if you think he has abused his office for gain. You will say not guilty if you think he has not abused his office or he has abused his office but not for gain. If you say not guilty you will be asked if you find him guilty of the alternative offence of abuse of office. (iv) You may now retire to deliberate your opinions. When you are ready with the opinions, I will reconvene the court and ask your individual opinion. You are at liberty to peruse any of the documents tendered to court as exhibits when deliberating the issues. (v) Any re-directions or additions to what I said in my summing up Mr. Blanchflower M and Mr. Keene B?
