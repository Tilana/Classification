NACANI TIMO Counsels : Ms S Kiran for the State 3rd Accused in Person Date of Hearing : 04-05th June & 09th June 2014 Date of Ruling : 10 June 2014 VOIR DIRE RULING 1. The State seeks to adduce into evidence the record of a caution interview of the accused on 23.7.2013 and charge statement dated 24.7.2013. The accused objects to the admissibility of this document on the grounds that this statement was obtained involuntarily through pressure, intimidation and threats by the police. 2. The test of admissibility of all confessional statement made to the Police officer, is whether that was made freely and not as a result of threats, assaults or inducements made to the accused by person or persons in authority. Further, oppression or unfairness also leads to the exclusion of the confession. Finally, where the rights of the suspects under Section 27 of the previous Constitution have been breached, this will lead to the exclusion of the confessions obtained thereby unless the prosecution can show that the suspect was not thereby prejudiced. 3. The preamble of the Judges Rules states as follows: "That it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a person in authority, or by oppression." 4. The Privy Council, In the case of Wong Kam-ming v The Queen (1980) A.C. 247, P.C., observed that: "[t]he basic control over the admissibility of statements are found in the evidential rule that an admission must be voluntary i.e. not obtained through violence, fear or prejudice, oppression, threats and promises or other improper inducements. See decision of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v R (1914-15) AER 874 at 877. It is to the evidence that the court must turn for an answer to the voluntariness of the confessions." 5. The Fiji Court of Appeal in case of the Ganga Ram and Shiu Charan v R (FCA Crim. App. 46/1983) outlined the two-part test for the exclusion of confessions at page 8: "It will be remembered that there are two matters each of which requires consideration in this area. First, it must be established affirmatively by the crown beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary in the sense that they were not procured by improper practices such as use of force, threats or prejudice or inducement by offer of some advantage-what has been picturesquely described as 'flatter of hope or thetyranny of fear.' Ibrahim v R (1914) A.C. 559; DPP v Pin Lin (1976 )A.C. 574. Secondly, even if such voluntariness is established, there is also need to consider whether the more general ground of unfairness exists in the way in which the police behaved, perhaps by breach of the Judges Rules falling short of over bearing the will, by trickery or by unfair treatment. Regina v Sanag (1980) A.C. 402, 436CE). This is a matter of overriding discretion and one cannot specifically categorize the matters which might be taken into account." 6. It is for me to decide whether interviews were conducted freely and not as a result of threats, assaults or inducements made to the accused by a person or persons in authority. Secondly, if I find that there has been oppression or unfairness, then I can in my discretion exclude the interviews. Finally, if his rights under the Constitution or common law have been breached, then that will lead to exclusion of the confessions obtained thereby, unless the prosecution can show that the suspect was not thereby prejudiced. These rights include such rights as having a legal representative of his choice and having access to family, next-of-kin or religious counselor. 7. The burden of proving voluntariness, fairness, lack of oppression, compliance with common law rights, where applicable, and if there is noncompliance, lack of prejudice to the accused rests at all times with the prosecution. They must prove these matters beyond reasonable doubt. In this ruling I have reminded myself of that. 8. Now I look at the evidence presented in respect of the caution interview and charge statement. 9. The first witness was DC Solo Nasilasila. He is an officer with 10 years experience.

After the close of the prosecution case, I found a case to answer from the accused in the trial within a trial and explained the accused his rights. 25. The accused gave evidence. He was arrested on 22.7.2013 in the afternoon. He was at home with his wife, her elder brother and his wife. Strike back team from Nabua police station came looking for him. When he came out of the house they started beating him up. He was not informed the reasons for arrest. He was beaten in front of his wife. 26. Then he was taken to Nabua police station. He was beaten with batons and hose pipes there. There was a cut on his face and he felt pain in his back and chest. They stopped beating when they saw that he had a black eye. 27. Same afternoon he was taken to Lautoka police station. He was assaulted there by an Inspector in the crime office. When he was taken to record statement on 23rd he was forced and threatened. When the statement was taken he requested to go to the toilet and have water, but that was refused. He was told that he will not be given breaks until he admits the crime. When he was taken back to cell same day around 6.00 p.m. cell mates had enquired about the injuries. He did not speak much as he had injuries. 28. Next day the interview was completed first and then he was charged. When he was charged he was beaten again. He was produced in court and taken to remand. He was not allowed in the prison as there were injuries on him. Then he was taken to Magistrate the following day. He had requested for a medical examination. When he was taken to the doctor all his injuries were recorded by the doctor. 29. Under cross examination he said that about five officers assaulted him at the time of the arrest with hose pipes and batons. He denied that he and his wife were taken to Nabua police station at different times in separate vehicles. He denied being taken to O'Reilly's night club. At Nabua police station he was assaulted by several officers using batons and hose pipes. They caused the cut on his head, punched him on the face and assaulted him on chest and back for few minutes. Black eye was caused by few minutes beating at Nabua police station. He had this till the day he was remanded. 30. At Lautoka police station he was punched on his nose with fist once by the Inspector. At the time he came to Lautoka police station he had the injury on the forehead and black eyes on both eyes. He also had pain throughout his body. He had black eyes and pain in the body at the time he went for medical examination. He had told about this to the doctor. He denied going to a night club before the day of the arrest. He denied that the injuries are from a fight at the night club. 31. The force used during the caution interview is that he doesn't admit he will be assaulted again. He said that he was assaulted during the interview as well. When he went back to cell after the interview he had shown cut on the forehead, broken nose, black eyes chest and back to the cell mates. The charging officer had used his fist to poke his injured forehead. 32. He admitted that he did not make a complaint to the Magistrate when he was firstly produced before him. 33. The third accused called two witnesses to give evidence on his behalf. Both were cell mates at the Lautoka police station on 23.7.2013. The first witness was Alexio Moli. He stated that when he came to cell around 7.00 p.m. Timo had cuts on his forehead and nose. His cheek was swollen. He had told him that police assaulted him forcing him to admit the allegation against him. He had complained of body pains and looked scared. 34. Under cross examination, he said that Timo was lying down when he arrived. The cut on the forehead was U shape deep cut. It was a fresh injury. The cut on the top of the nose was about inch or 1 inch. It was dry. No blood coming out from injuries. Timo had told him that he was assaulted since the date of arrest. Timo had black eyes. He had same black eyes following morning and on the 25th when he was brought to Natabua remand center. 35. The next witness was Inosi Laqekoro. When he saw the accused on 23.7.2013 after 6.00 p.m. there was cuts on his forehead, top of his nose and swelling on the cheek. The accused had told him that he was assaulted by police. The injuries were fresh and blood was coming out from forehead and nose. 36. Under cross examination he stated that the cut on the forehead was deep and in shape of a sloping line. The accused was trying to wipe off blood using his hand. There was redness on the forehead. There was big swelling on the nose and blood coming out. There was big swelling on the cheek. The accused was not talking properly. He said that he came to the cell with Alexio Moli. The accused had red eyes. That was there the following morning and when he saw the accused next at Natabua prison. 37. I have carefully considered the available evidence in respect of the caution interview on 23.7.2013 and the charge statement on 24.7.2013 of the accused. 38. Accordingly, I have come to the view that in regard to any allegation of assault, pressure, intimidation and threats by the police, the state had satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that it did not happen. I reject the evidence of the accused and his witnesses that he was assaulted and forced before, during this caution interview and charge statement. 39. Police officers have recorded the injuries on the accused when he was firstly taken to Lautoka police station. According to the cell book entry, there was a cut on his forehead even at that time. The doctor had not seen black eyes on both eyes as claimed by the accused. Further accused had not complained to the doctor about chest or back pain. Only injuries the accused had were bruises on the forehead, cheek and fracture of the nasal bone. The two witnesses called by the accused gave two different versions regarding freshness of the injuries. One witness said that there was blood coming out from the nose and forehead. Other said there was no blood. There was no mention about black/red eyes or pain in the chest or back in the medical report. There is no mention about nature of injuries sustained by the accused in his voir-dire grounds filed. The medical report in this was prepared only last week. I cannot believe the accused or his witnesses on the injuries on the accused. 40. I am satisfied that the interviews were voluntary, that those were obtained in fair circumstances, that those were in no way oppressed or beaten out of the accused in contravention of his rights either under the Judges' Rules or of the Constitution which was not in operation. 41. The caution interview of the accused on 23.7.2013 and the charge statement of 24.7.2013, being voluntary made and not created out of oppression is therefore admissible in evidence.
