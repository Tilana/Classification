I will direct on matters of law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of facts however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about facts of the case or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinion. In other words you are the judges of facts. All matters of facts are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject. [02] You have to decide what facts are proved and what inferences drawn from those facts. You then apply law as I explain it to you and form your individual opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. [03] Prosecution and defence made their submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept or reject. [04] You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinions of yourself and your opinion need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgement. [05] On the question of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law that the onus of burden of proof lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts. There is no obligation on the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our criminal justice system accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. This is the golden rule. [06] The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of the accused's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty. [07] Proof can be established only through evidence. Evidence can be from direct evidence that is the evidence that who saw the incident or felt the offence being committed. A witness can give evidence on his observations, like what he heard, what he saw and what he perceived by his own senses. That is called direct evidence. [08] The other kind of evidence is circumstantial evidence that if, on consideration a series of pieces of evidence, you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn is the guilt of the accused, and there is no other reasonable explanation for the circumstances which is consistant with the accused's innocence, then you may convict the accused for the offence charged. Circumstantial evidence can be more powerful than direct evidence. Let me give an example:-If you one day find that your wallet is missing and the only person who could have entered your house is your house is your neighbour, and you find your credit card is hidden in his desk in his home, then you are entitled to accept that it was your neighbour who stole your wallet. This is because the circumstances lead you to the only reasonable inference. However if other people have access to your house and the credit card is not found in his house, then there are other possible explanations which are also consistence with his innocence. [09] Evidence presented in the form of a document is called Documentary evidence. eg: medical examination form, caution interview statement etc. [10] In certain circumstances the court would allow witnesses to give their opinions on a matter. Theses witnesses should be experts on that particular subject. For example, you get experts on medical field. [11] The caution interview statement of the accused person is in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence against him. I will direct you shortly on how you should consider that evidence. [12] Your decisions must be solely and exclusively upon the evidence, which you have heard in this court and upon nothing else. You must disregard anything you have heard about this case outside of this court room. [13] Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence apply the law to those facts. Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotions. [14] Now let's look at the charge. Statement of Offence MURDER: Contrary to Section 237 of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009. DEVENDRA NAIKER on the 20th day of December 2011, at Nausori in the Eastern Division, murdered BISHAL ANAND MISHRA. [15] In law, murder is made up of three elements; 1. a person engages in conduct 2. that conduct causes the death of another person 3. the person intends to cause the death, or is reckless as to causing the death of another person by the conduct. [16] The phrase "engages in conduct" in paragraph 15(1) hereof, means "to do a physical act". Example: stabbing, strangling, poisoning. [17] The phrase "the conduct causes the death of another person" as described in paragraph 15(2) hereof, means that the act must be substantial and a major cause of the person's death. Example stabbing on deceased's chest was a major and substantial cause of death. Without stabbing, deceased would not have died. [18] As to the element No: 3 in Paragraph 15(3) hereof, it must be shown that, when an accused allegedly stab the deceased "he was reckless as to a risk that his stabbing will cause serious harm to the deceased". [19] A person is reckless, with respect to a result, if he is aware of substantial risk that the result will occur, and having regards to the circumstances known to him, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. The question of whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of the facts. [20] The first element is called the physical element of the offence while the second element indicates the causal link. The third is call mental element. You have to always bear in mind that all three elements should be established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution at all times together for it to succeed in the charge of murder. [21] You must remember, if the accused person did not have the intention or recklessness to cause the death or any bodily harm which could cause death; or, if you have a doubt on that then the accused person, cannot be found guilty of murder. That is because, without intention or recklessness the offence of murder cannot be committed. You must be clear on this. [22] If you conclude that there was no intention for the act of the accused or if you have any reasonable doubt about it, then you must find the accused person not guilty. [23] I now remind you of the prosecution and defence cases. In doing this it would be tedious and impractical for me to go through the evidence of every witness in detail and repeat every submission made by the counsel. I will summarize the salient features. If I do not mention a particular witness, or a particular piece of evidence that does not mean it is unimportant. You should consider and evaluate all the evidence and all the submissions in coming to your decision in this case. [24] Now let's look at the evidence led by the prosecution in this case. [25] The first witness was Dhiren Prasad brother-in-law of the deceased. Deceased was married to his elder sister. On 20/12/2011 the accused called him and inquired of the whereabouts of the deceased and his wife wife. He knew the accused as they are living in the same community. As the accused called him again, he inquired from him the reason for calling. The accused said that he had arranged a goat for the deceased. He identified the accused in open court. [26] In the cross examination witness said that the accused had asked whether his sister went to the market on that day. [27] Vikash Anand Mishra the brother of the deceased had seen the accused going to Peter Fong's Shop and carrying a small bag with a handle. He knew the accused as they live in the same community. When the witness called his brother regarding the car tyre, he told him over the phone that he would bring the same on the following day. In the meantime accused had called deceased and asked him to drop at Korociriciri. As it was 6.45pm on 20/12/2011, he went home. But the deceased never returned home. When he inquired about his deceased brother, he came to know that he had been murdered. At 7.45 pm deceased's wife had given a call and inquired about the deceased. [28] In the cross examination witness said that he saw the accused carrying a black colour bag. Defence counsel marked a photograph as D1. Questions directed to the witness to identify Vuci Road, the road going towards Korociriciri and Waituri. Deceased's wife had told him that the deceased's phone was answered by a Fijian man. Deceased's wife is not a witness in this case. [29] Asish Sami alias Pulle met the accused on 20/12/2011 at Nausori town. He is a friend of the accused. As they met after a long time, both decided to go for a drink, before the accused went to LTA to attend some work. After their return from LTA they went to Nausori Club and consumed beer till 4.00pm. After that he went home and the accused remained in Nausori Town. He identified the accused in open court. [30] In the cross examination witness said that the accused told him how he sustained injury on his shoulder while at work. He did not see the accused wearing anything on his shoulder. [31] Rickey Rajneel Nadan said that on 20/12/2011 while he parked his taxi at R.B Taxi Base the accused had gone there and had a chat with him inside his taxi. This happened between 3.00pm to 4.00pm. He identified the accused in open court. [32] Melvin Nadan, brother in law of the deceased said that he saw the accused going in the deceased's taxi No: LT 3915 at about 6.20pm on 20/12/2011. Before that when he parked his taxi at R.B. Taxi Base the accused went there and inquired about the whereabouts of the deceased. He identified the accused in open court. [33] In the cross examination witness said that the accused came to the taxi base at about 6.00pm and left with the deceased at about 6.20pm. It was not really dark on that day. [34] Divesh Karan a taxi driver by profession also corroborated the version of Melvin Nadan mentioned above. He identified the accused in open court. [35] Nand Lal is a farmer. His farm is situated at Korociriciri and his home is situated at Waituri. On 20/12/2011 at about 6.00pm, he was not sure about the time, when he was returning from his farm on a bicycle, he had seen a taxi near Waituri roundabout. Two people were inside. One was seated on the driving seat and the other was seated on left side of the back seat. The man seated on the driving seat was looking at the back seat while the other man's face was facing down ward. He could not identify anybody in the taxi at that time. According to him it was not really dark at that time. [36] In the cross examination defence counsel showed another photograph and marked as D2. According to the witness the taxi was parked further down to the taxi parked in the photograph. [37] In re-examination witness said that the road appears in D2 is the Waituri road and the taxi he saw on 20/12/2011 was parked on the same road. [38] According to Tevita Naqaruqaru he lives in Waituri with his family. On 20/12/2011 at about 6.30pm while his family were having dinner he heard a vehicle going very fast on the farm road. As it was unusual for a vehicle to go on that speed on dilapidated farm road, on the instructions of his uncle, he and Meli ran after the vehicle which stopped on the Farm Road. An Indian man alighted from the vehicle and started to run. When both shouted "thief" the man threw something to the nearby bush. He stopped to see what he had thrown while Meli went after him. As he could not find what he had thrown he then ran up to the man. The man was wearing a long pants and he removed the same and threw it out. Inside the pants he was wearing a short. Meli caught the man when he tried to run towards a shortcut which leads to Korociriciri. At that point the man was crying and knelt down in front of them. He was in that position for about 20 minutes. Witness identified the Indian man in open court as the accused in this case. [39] In the cross examination witness said that he remembered the accused face very well. Witness denied that he assaulted and robbed the Indian man on 20/12/2011. The behaviour of the Indian man let him think that he had did something wrong. After seeing blood on both of his hands they interrogated the Indian man. The Indian man told them that he went to buy a goat with his friend and two Fijian men assaulted them. He further said that his friend was lying there and he ran away with the taxi. Feeling sorry for the man, both let the accused go away. [40] D/Cpl-1928 was instructed to photograph the crime scene by Sgt/Rakesh on 20/12/2011. He then went to Waituri Irrigation. The place was cordoned off by the police. As it was dark he used a torch light to take photographs. He noticed blood stains on the road. Within one meter on the left side of the road a dead body of a male was lying there with face upward. He was wearing a blue jeans and black and red stripe T-shirt. Stab wounds noted on his chest, chin and neck. On the following day he photographed the taxi which had been abandoned on Irrigation farm road.

[42] Ratu Meli Draunimasi who ran after the taxi on 20/12/2011 at farm road gave evidence next. Confirming the evidence of Tevita Naqaruqaru he said when he ran after the vehicle it had stopped near Bobby's house. The colour of the car is either brown or dark grey. When he went closer, an Indian man dark in complexion alighted from the car and ran towards Korociriciri. He and Tevita caught the man but he worshiped both and told them that two Fijian men were looking for him with regard to a deal for a goat. As he felt sorry for him he let him go from there. Witness had seen blood on both his hands. He was talking to the Indian man for about 15 minutes and he identified the accused as the Indian man.

Analysis of the Evidence [64] Madam and Gentlemen assessors, in this case it is not in dispute that the accused went in the rear seat of the deceased's taxi after 6.00pm on 20/12/2011. Accused admitted in his evidence that he went home in the deceased's taxi on 20/12/2011. This was corroborated by witnesses Melvin Nandan and Dinesh Karan. According to them, the accused was the person last seen going in the deceased's taxi after 6.00pm on 20/12/2011. [65] The presence of the accused in Nausori town on 20/12/2011 was very well established by the witnesses Vikash Anand Mishra, Asish Sami alias Pulle and Rickey Rajneel Nadan. This too was not in dispute as accused admitted that he went to Nausori town on 20/12/2011 to look for his driving permit from LTA.

According to police investigation the dead body of the deceased was found on the Waituri Irrigation road. The taxi was abandoned 1.5km away from the dead body. You have to consider this evidence carefully. [68] Madam and Gentlemen assessors, you heard evidence of Tevita Naqaruqaru and Ratu Meli Draunimasi. They live in Waituri with their family. On 20/12/2011 at about 6.30pm while his family were having dinner, he heard a vehicle going very fast on the farm road. As it was unusual for vehicle to go on that speed on dilapidated farm road, on the instructions of their uncle, both ran after the vehicle which stopped on the Farm Road. An Indian man alighted from the vehicle and started to run. When both shouted "thief" the man had threw something to the nearby bush. The man was wearing a long pants and he removed the same and threw it out. Inside the pants he was wearing a short. Meli caught the man when he tried to run towards a shortcut which leads to Korociriciri. At that point the man was crying and knelt down in front of them. He was in that position for about 20 minutes. Witnesses identified the Indian man in open court as the accused in this case. Also noted blood on both of his hand. The accused told them that he was attacked by two Fijian men. The taxi was found on the Irrigation road where these two witnesses confronted the accused. Though Ratu Meli failed to identify the accused at the identification parade due to excitement, he identified the accused from the dock. Consider their evidence with great caution. [69] It is not in dispute that the accused went to drink grog in the night of 20/12/2011 and went home upon receiving a call from the accused's home. Also not in dispute that he went to the police on 21/12/2011 as per the request of the police. [70] All the police officers involved in the investigation, arresting, and recording of caution interview and charge statement of the accused denied assaulting the accused. As I told you earlier the caution interview statement of the accused person is in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence against him. But you have to consider the position taken by the accused with regard to his caution interview and charge statement. The accused says that he was severely beaten by the police from the day of his arrest until his charge statement was recorded. The accused gave evidence and explained to this court how he was treated by the police. According to him during recording of his caution interview and charge statement he was assaulted, intimidated and threatened. Accused denied the charge. Consider accused's evidence before you give any consideration to the caution interview statement and charge statement of the accused. [71] Two doctors had examined the accused on 22/12/2011 and 24/12/2011. Both doctors gave evidence as experts in the medical field. According to Dr. IIisapeci Lasaro[Mrs] the accused told her that he was acting in self defence and in the process he unintentionally stabbed him several times on the neck and chest of the deceased. He also said that he sustained laceration on finger tips of the left hand whist trying to defend himself as they were arguing about the story of accused having an affair with the deceased's wife. Healed abrasions on the palm of his left thumb, index and middle ring finger was seen on the accused's hand. [72] According to Dr. Upendra Singh who had examined the accused on 24/12/2011 as part of routine check up. He was examined in a closed room. The accused was normal when he was produced before him. There was mild rib cage tenderness on the accused and muscle strain on the accused's left thigh. The doctor was not sure whether the rib cage tenderness was due to a punch on the chest. But his explanation in detail, he said that tenderness noted could be due to any small impact, an old injury, and born pain or even psychological. [73] Both doctors said that the accused did not complaint of any assault or intimidation by the police during the examination. Apart from a minor injury, no major injury/injuries noted on the accused's body. Though he had the opportunity to inform the doctors about the police assault but he did not tell anything against the police. [74] Dr. Goundar gave evidence and explained in detail the injuries sustained by the deceased. Considering the pattern of the injuries, the doctor expressed his expert opinion that the assailant, most probably, had attacked the deceased from his back. The doctor had noted 11 external injuries and one fatal cut injury to the heart. According to Dr Goundar the death was caused due to multiple cut injuries to the chest. [75] Accused gave evidence in this case. He admits that he travelled in the deceased's taxi on 20/12/2011 after 6.00pm. He also admits giving the history to Dr. IIisapeci Lasaro[Mrs]. Denying the charge, the accused said that he was subjected to severe police assault while he was in police custody. He had not taken any endeavour to inform this to either the doctors or to the magistrate, even though he had ample opportunity. As Assessors and Judges of facts you have to consider this evidence very carefully. [76] The prosecution produced Photographic Booklet of the crime scene. Do not be emotional after seeing those photographs. The only reason behind the production of those photographs is to get an idea of the crime scene and not to draw any sympathy. [77] Madams and gentlemen assessors, in this case accused opted to give evidence from the witness box. That is his right. But he has nothing to prove to you. [78] I have summarized all the evidence before you. But, still I might have missed some. That is not because they are unimportant. You heard every items of evidence and you should remind yourself of all that evidence and form your opinion on facts. What I did was only to draw your attention to the salient items of evidence and help you in reminding yourself of the evidence. [79] You have heard all the prosecution witnesses. You have observed them giving evidence in the court. You have observed their demeanour in the court. Considering my direction on the law, your life experiences and common sense, you should be able to decide which witness's evidence, or part of their evidence you consider reliable, and therefore to accept, and which witness's evidence, you consider unreliable and therefore to reject. [80] You must also carefully consider the accused's position as stated above. Please remember, even if you reject the version of the accused that does not mean that the prosecution had established the case against the accused. You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused. [81] Ladies and gentleman assessors, remember, it is for the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden stays with them throughout the trial. [82] Once again, I remind, that your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the law to those facts and come to a correct finding. Do not get carried away by emotions. [83] This is all I have to say to you. You may now retire to deliberate. The clerks will advise me when you have reached your individual decisions, and we will reconvene the court. [84] Any re-directions? I thank you for your patient hearing to my summing-up. P Kumararatnam JUDGE At Suva 09/04/2014</p></div></div></body></html>
