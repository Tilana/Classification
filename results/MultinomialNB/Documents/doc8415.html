Established authorities suggest that the tariff for the said offence including theft is between 12 months - 4 years (see: State v Jese Driu, HAC 143 of 2010; State v Tomasi Turuturuvesi [2002] HAA 86/02; Cavuilagi v State [2004] FJHC 92) 8. Theft under the Crimes Decree carries a maximum imprisonment term of 10 years. The guideline in case authorities suggest that tariff for theft ranges from 2-9 months for 1st convictions and between 9 24 months for 2nd convictions depending on the value of the goods and circumstances of the stealing.

For your early guilty plea I give a discount of 6 months and for other mitigating factors I further reduce your sentence by 2 months. Your final sentence for burglary is 12 months imprisonment. 12. For the offence of theft I consider the aggravating factors and balanced with the mitigating factors I sentence you to 9 months imprisonment. 13. To give effect to the principle of deterrence you are sentenced to 12 months for burglary and 9 months for theft. Since both offences were committed in one transaction both sentences are to be served concurrently. In total 12 months imprisonment. 14. I now consider whether your sentence should be suspended. This is not your first offence since you've admitted having four previous convictions and three which is for similar offending. You cannot expect the leniency of the court therefore your sentence will not be suspended. Further there are no exceptional or compelling circumstances to suspend your sentence. 15. You will serve and immediate imprisonment term of 12 months. 16. 28 days to appeal. Samuela Qica Resident Magistrate 15th January 2013</p></div></div></body></html>
