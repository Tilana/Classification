ABU0066 OF 1998S (High Court Civil Action No. HBC 0331 of 1994S) BETWEEN ABDUL KADEER KUDDUS HUSSEIN Appellant AND: NATIONAL BANK OF FIJI Respondent Coram:Reddy, P Barker, JA Davies, JA Hearing: Tuesday 26 February 2002, Suva Counsel: Appellant in Person Mr. Subhas Parshotam for the Respondent Date of Oral Judgment: 26 February 2002 ORAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT Reddy, P., Presiding Judge There are two applications before the Court. First, the Appellant seeks leave of this Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. If leave is granted, he seeks a stay of all proceedings in the matter until the final determination of his appeal by the Supreme Court. The Appellants petition sets out four proposed grounds of appeal. None of the grounds raise any questions of public importance calling for further argument and decision of the Supreme Court. Nor do they raise any questions of general principle requiring consideration and decision by the Supreme Court. All the points raised involve decisions on the particular facts of this case. Since none of the grounds raise questions of significant public importance leave is refused. The application for stay must also be refused. Barker JA I agree that both applications should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Presiding Judge. Davies JA I also agree. Reddy P In accordance with the unanimous opinion of the Judges both applications are dismissed. No order as to costs. Hon J.R. Reddy Presiding Judge Hon Sir Ian Barker Justice of Appeal Hon Justice J. Davies Justice of Appeal</p></div></div></body></html>
