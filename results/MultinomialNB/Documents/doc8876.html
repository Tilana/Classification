(ii) Category 2: Possession of 100 to 1,000 gram of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be asentencebetween 1 to 3 years imprisonment, with those possessing below 500 grams, being sentenced to less than 2 years, and those possessing more than 500 grams, be sentenced to more than 2 years imprisonment. (iii) Category 3: possessing 1,000 to 4,000 grams of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be asentencebetween 3 to 7 years, with those possessing less than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to less than 4 years imprisonment, and those possessing more than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to more than 4 years. (iv) Category 4: possessing 4,000 grams and above of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be asentencebetween 7 to 14 years imprisonment." 5. I find no aggravating factors in this case and since the accused is absconding I have no opportunity to consider the mitigating factors on his behalf. But the accused has no valid conviction which would entitle him some discount. 5. I select 02 years as my starting point and deduct 01 year for his past good behavior to reach 01 year imprisonment. 6. Considering the nature of the offence I do not see any compelling reason to suspend this sentence. 7. Therefore the accused is sentenced to 01 year imprisonment for the offence of Possession of Drugs contrary to section 5(a) of the Illicit Drugs Control Act No. 9 of 2004. 8. As the accused is absconding this sentence will be activated from the date of his apprehension. 9. Since this court is exercising the extended jurisdiction of the High Court in this case, the parties may appeal against this sentence within 30 days with leave to the Court of Appeal. H. S. P.
