The plaintiff objects to this application on the following grounds: (i) The defendants have not satisfied the test for discovery. They have not made out a case for relevance of most of the documents they seek discovery of. (ii) The defendants have not identified with precision (iii) Legal professional privilege. (iv) The defendants have not made out a prima faacie case for the existence of documents (which according to the plaintiff does not exist.) B. LAW AND ANALYSIS 8. Order 24 rule 7 of the High court Rules states: "7. (1) Subject to rule 8, the Court may at any time, on the application of any party to a cause or matter, make an order requiring any other party to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application or any class of document so specified or described is, or has at any time been, in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it. (2) An order may be made against a party under this rule not withstanding that he may already have made or been required to make a list of documents or affidavit under rule 2 or rule 3. (3) An application for an order under this rule must be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the party from who discovery is sought under this rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, custody or power the document, or class of document, specified or described in the application and that it relates to one or more of the matters in question in the cause or matter." 9. And Order 24, rule 8 states: "8. On the hearing of an application for an order under rule 3 or 7, the Court, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, may dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs." 10. The application must be supported by an affidavit stating the requirements contained in the Order 24 rule 7(3) and the said requirements are as follows a. To the belief the documents or the class of documents specified or described are in possession, custody or power of the party whom the discovery is sought, or at some time in the past. b. It relates to one or more of the matters in question. 11. The affidavit in support sworn by the 2nd Defendant at paragraph 3 states as follows 'I verily believe that all the following documents and class of documents relate to one or more of the matters in question in this action can are therefore discoverable by the plaintiff.' 12. The said affidavit in support further at paragraph 4 states as follows 'I verily believe that the plaintiff or its solicitors Jamandas & associates has had or at some time had, in their possession, custody or power in the ordinary course of business, the documents or class of document, specified or described in paragraph 3 hereof and if not now in their possession, custody or power, they can say when they parted with it and what has become of it.' 13. In the paragraph 3 the 2nd Defendant states that the documents he sought are discoverable by the Plaintiff, but in the paragraph 4 he states that the said documents to his belief were with the Plaintiff or its solicitors Jamandas & Associates. 14. The notice of motion filled on 12th May, 2011 seeking discovery state as follows 'a. The Plaintiff shall within 14 days serve on the defendant an affidavit verifying the list of particular documents or classes of document described in the affidavit of Kenneth Chambers filed therein, stating whether any document specified or described or any class of document so specified or described in, or has at any time been in its possession, custody or power and if not then in its possession custody or power, when it parted with it any what has become of it.' 15. Supreme Court Practice (1999) at p 471 24/7/2 state as follows '&.the present rule an application may be made for an affidavit as to specific document or classes of documents. This must be supported by an affidavit stating that in the belief of he deponent other party has or has had prima facie case is made out for (a) possesson, custody or power and (b) relevance of the specified documents (Astra National Production Ltd v neo Art productions Ltd [1928]W.N. 218. This case may be base merely on the probability arising from the surrounding circumstances or in part on specific facts deposed to. See too Berkeley administration v McClelland [1990] F.S.R. 381 where at p 382 the Court restated the principles as follows; (1) There is no jurisdiction to make an order under RSC O24 r 7 for the production of documents unless (a) there is sufficient evidence that the documents exist which the other party has not disclosed. (b) the document or documents relate to matters in issue in the action (c) there is sufficient evidence that the document is in the possession, custody or power of the other party. (2) When it is established that those three prerequisites for jurisdiction do exist, the court has discretion whether or not to order disclosure.' (emphasis added) 16. The Plaintiff's affidavit in support falls short of those above requirements in the following one or more i. It has failed to adduce sufficient evidence that each document exists which the other party has not disclosed this may be excused as certain documents and their custody have been admitted by the Plaintiff but it has categorically denied the existence of some of the documents. In any event since the affidavit in support must contain averments as to their existence and mere belief is not sufficient as per the above judgment since they are prerequisites and only upon the proof of the said three prerequisites that the court obtains jurisdiction to deal with it and can exercise its discretion. So, some evidence of as to why such belief was arrived at by the applicant is needed to be sworn in the affidavit in opposition. ii. The document or documents should relate to matters in issue in the action and that has to be anerred in the affidavit with particulars as to the relevancy. This has been completely ignored by the Defendant's affidavit in support. The Defendants in their counterclaim has claimed for 10 causes of actions against the Plaintiff. Apart from that I have been entrusted with the task of assessing the damages incurred to the Defendants by the Court of Appeal, due to the interlocutory injunction obtained by the Plaintiff that ultimately resulted the burial of the dead body of the son of 2nd Defendant, contrary to the wishes of the 2nd Defendant. The court of appeal directed me to assess the damages while dismissing the interlocutory injunction on the basis of locus standi of the Plaintiff to seek such an order. I have this matter before me for assessment of damages and there are ten counter claims in the statement of defence of the defendants. So, it is needed to relate to these documents to each of the claim and or to the assessment of damages and also explain the relationship in detail. Without it the court would not be able to make an order as to the relevancy of the documents. iii. There is no sufficient evidence in the affidavit in support swearing that each of that the document is in the possession, custody or power of the Plaintiff from whom the Plaintiff is seeking discovery in terms of the notice of motion seeking discovery.In the notice of motion the Defendant is only seeking discovery against the Plaintiff and stated 'The Plaintiif shall within 14 days serve on the defendant' the documents described in the affidavit in support, but in contrast to this the affidavit in support at paragraph 4 stated that 'I verily believethat the plaintiff or its solicitors Jamandas & associates has had or at some time had, in their possession, custody or power in the ordinary course of business.' 17. No affidavit evidence was led on this an especially on the (ii) above, considering that there are 10 alleged causes of actions alleged against the Plaintiff in the counter claim filled by the Defendants and also there is a pending hearing for assessment of damages as per the direction of the Court of Appeal, I need to be satisfy as to the relationship of the documents to the issues before the court. The matter is complicated and each document needs to be relate to one or more issues and that has to be specified distinctly in the affidavit in support and also that has to be swon evidence of the appliants, to satisfy the prerequisits in order to exercise discreption of the court to order discovery. C. CONCLUSIONS 18. There are three prerequisites as laid down in the case of Berkeley administration v McClelland [1990] F.S.R. 381 and upon the proof of the said three prerequisites only the court will obtain the jurisdiction to exercise its discretion as to an order for discovery as stated in the said judgment. 19. Since the affidavit in support has not complied with the mandatory provision of the law as contained in the Order 24 rule 7 I will dismiss this application for discovery, and the cost of this application will be cost in the cause for the Plaintiff. D. FINAL ORDER a. The motion for discovery filled by the 2nd Defendant on 12th May 2011 is dismissed. b. The cost of this application will be cost in the cause for the Defendant. Dated at Suva this 3rd day of February, 2012. Mr. Deepthi Amaratunga Master of the High Court Suva</p></div></div></body></html>
