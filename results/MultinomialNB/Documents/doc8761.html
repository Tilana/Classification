[16] Under cross examination PW5 stated that he could not recall whether the accused had injury. He also said he was preparing the file when asked by the accused where he was on the first call date of the case. [17] PW5 was not cross examined by the prosecution. [18] A summary of the evidence of PW6 was that: "I am the witnessing officer of caution interview of the accused.

[23] PW7 was also not cross examined by the prosecution. EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENCE [24] The accused is facing two charges under old Penal Code. Therefore, the court explained the three options that were available to him under old Criminal Procedure Code. Accordingly, the accused chose to give unsworn evidence. He did not call any witnesses to give evidence on his behalf. [25] In unsworn evidence the accused stated that: "& I was taken to hospital. One of the Crime Officers who took me to the hospital passed away. This case was fist called on 21/04/2006. That day it was on the media. They tendered photo copy of the caution interview". THE RELATING TO ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE [26] As far as it applies, section 293-1 (b) of the Penal Code states: 293.-(1) Any person who- (a) &; or (b) robs any person and, at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, uses or threatens to use any personal violence to any person, [27] The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: a. the accused; b. robbed the complainants: c. at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery used or threatened to use personal violence to the complainants. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE [28] The accused is charged with two counts of robbery with violence. It is alleged the accused on 13 April 2006 robbed PW1 of $200-00 in cash, assorted recharge cards valued at $350-00, two packets of BH 20 valued at $8-40 all to the total value of $558-40 and immediately before such threatened to use personnel violence to PW1. On the same day he also robbed PW2 of $15-00 in cash and immediately before such robbery threatened to use personnel violence to the PW2. [29] PW1 in evidence stated that on 13 April 2006 at approximately 3.30 am when he was counting the stocks at total Service Station about six persons entered the shop after breaking the glass with the hammer and demanded money if not they will cut his neck. Except the accused all of them were wearing mask. They were carrying cane knife and pinch bar. They took cash, recharge and cigarettes. He said that the accused was in front of him without mask that he identified him clearly in the light. [30] PW2 testified that he is a taxi driver. On 13 April 2006 at around 3.00 am he got a job. A girl hired him to travel from Nadi to Waimalika. He didn't know the passenger girl. The girl wanted to buy a recharge card. So he stopped at Namaka Service Station. Then we heard glass breaking sound. There were 5 or 6 guys. Accused was without mask, others were wearing mask. He told that the accused demanded money by threatening to kill him (PW2). He had a cane knife with him. PW2 got afraid and gave all the money he had ($15.00) to the accused. He said the accused was too close to him without mask and he identified the accused as there was light. [31] Under cross examination PW2 stated that he could not recall the Bowser's name. The accused was carrying an axe. He was with us and went off in a car. He threatened me, got money and went away. He saw the accused once in court. [32] PW3 the passenger girl also gave evidence for the prosecution. In her evidence she stated that at about 3.30 am on that day when she was at the Namaka Bowser she saw six men, five with mask and one without mask. The guy without mask was a Fijian. He took the drive and her to the back. There was street and store light at the back. The accused was too close to them. The accused had an axe or hammer. He talked to the driver. She saw the accused for five minutes in the light. She identified the accused from the dock as the person who was without mask on that day. [33] It is to be noted that the accused has been identified by the prosecution witnesses PW1, PW2 and PW3. They told that they saw the accused for five minutes in the light on that day with the axe or hammer. [34] However, the accused disputed their dock identification on the basis there was no identification parade in the Police Station. He this is the first time they identify him in the dock. The accused has been arrested few hours after the incident on pursuit. PW1 stated that he saw the accused at the police station that day morning. PW1 saw the accused immediately after the incident at the Police Station. PW1 told to court that he clearly identified the accused. Further, PW2 and PW3 also confirmed that they identified the accused clearly in the light. Therefore the court disallowed the objection raised by the accused regarding dock identification. [35] I had already analyzed the evidence of PW4-PW7 in my voir dire ruling hence it is not necessary to discuss their evidence in this judgment. [36] The accused challenged the caution interview being tendered in evidence on the basis assault during interview and the statements therein were not voluntarily made. A voir dire inquiry was held to determine the voluntariness of the statement in the caution interview. I decided that the statements in the caution interview were made voluntarily hence it is admissible in evidence. Pursuant of my ruling on voir dire the prosecution led the caution interview of the accused along with the charge statement in evidence. [37] Under caution interview conducted with the accused he had made admissions to the two charges of robbery with violence allegedly committed on 13 April 2006 wherein he has said that "we broke the door of the grocery shop, Koli and another boy went inside the shop, Koli lifted the cash register, recharge cards, cigarettes and loaded in the van then the boy robbed the taxi driver" [38] In the charge statement the accused has said that "he was involved in this robbery at the Shell Service Station, Namaka with & some other boys whom he does not know. Only $200.00 and one $15.00 recharge card was given to him as his share. He had used the money and the recharge card". [39] The accused has sent two closing submissions to this court dated 4 April 2012 and 30 April 2012. He sent these submissions to court without seeking leave of the court. However, I have considered these submissions as he is unrepresented. In his submissions he has certain issues regarding police assault during caution interview, prosecution tendering photo copy of the caution interview and the dock identification. In my opinion these issues are not relevant in this judgment, for I have already decided these issues during the trial proper and in my ruling on vior dire inquiry. [40] Three prosecution witnesses (PW1-PW3) identified the accused and he has made voluntary statements in the caution interview and the charge statements admitting his involvement in the two robberies stated in the charges. [41] PW1-PW3 in evidence stated that they saw the accused having an axe or cane knife. They confirmed in court that they clearly identified the accused at that time. PW1 stated that they threatened to cut his neck before taking the items from the shop. PW2 stated that the accused took him to the corner and forcefully got all the money he had ($15.00) after threatening to kill. These witnesses evidence was not dented during cross examination. They gave forthright evidence. I therefore accept their evidence. [42] The prosecution succeeds in proving beyond reasonable doubt each element of the charges in both counts. [43] I therefore find the accused guilty as charged on both counts for robbery with violence, contrary to section 293-(1) of the Penal Code. I accordingly convict the accused. M. H.
