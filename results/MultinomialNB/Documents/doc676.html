HBC0250 OF 2001 BETWEEN: CARPENTERS FIJI LTD PLAINTIFF AND: MOHAMMED YAKUB KHAN AND COMPANY LIMITED DEFENDANT Mr S. Krishna for the Plaintiff No appearance for the Defendant Date of Hearing: 8 August 2005 Date of Judgment: 8 August 2005 ORAL JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J I have heard today formal proof of the Plaintiffs claim. Counsel on the record for the Defendant advised that his client had not responded to his letters and requests to come to his office and had not come to Court today. He sought and I granted leave for him to withdraw. On Mr Krishnas application I have struck out the statement of defence. I have heard the evidence of 2 of the Plaintiffs 3 witnesses who were here today and am satisfied that all claims in the statement of claim are made out. The sum proved as damages which in my view are special damages is less then the amount in the statement of claim. Counsel has abandoned prayer (a) in the statement of claim. I give judgment for the Plaintiff in the following terms: (a) The costs of repossession of the vehicle $1050.00; (b) The costs of replacement parts $25,136.06; (c) Interest on that letter amount at 6% per annum simple from the date that the losses were itemised, 21 October 2000 until today the date of judgment; (d) Indemnity costs which I assess at $10,000.00 including the expenses of bringing 3 employees from Suva for a full day. D.D. Finnigan JUDGE At Lautoka 8 August 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
