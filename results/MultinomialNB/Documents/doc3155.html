(the 2ndDefendant) 6. Analysis and assessment of damages. 6.1 Considering the evidence led before the Court, I conclude the following: 1) The plaintiff had given instructions to ANZ Bank to make the following payments out of the $129,798.62 from the Account of the Plaintiff a) Sun Insurance $5580. b) Commissioner of Inland Revenue $27718 c) Asco motors $49300 d) Fiji Development Bank $47200 6.2 The Plaintiff had claimed $129,798.62 as specific damageson the basis that the said payments were made for the benefit of the deceased Ratu Aisea Cavunailoa Katonivere.However the Plaintiff's evidence placed before this Court onlyproves the sum of $47200 was used to pay the loan of late Ratu Aisea Cavunailoa Katonivere obtained from Fiji Development Bank to discharge the Mortgage of the Crown Lease No.2957 which hadnow benefitted the Defendant who is the transferee. 6.3 However the Plaintiff failed to establish before this Court the other payments made to Sun Insurance, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and Asco Motors werepayments made for the liabilities of the late Ratu Aisea. 6.4 In the circumstances I award special damages of $47200 to the Plaintiff. 6.5 The Plaintiff's funds were utilized to pay the loan of theDefendant as such.The Plaintiff had lost income from the said sum of $47200 since 23/06/2006 accordingly. I award interest of the rate of 6% per annum from 23/06/2006up to the date of this Judgment which is calculated as follows. 6 x $47200 = 2832 = $7.75 per day 100 365 From 23/06/2006 up to 22/08/2014 = 2980 days x 7.75=$23,095 6.6 There is no any ground for this Court to use its discretion to award any General damages. Accordingly I award the Plaintiff: Special damages - $47200 Interest - $23095 $70295 Accordingly I make the following orders. a) The Defendant's are ordered to pay $70,295 as special damages. b) The Defendants are ordered to pay interest as the rate of 6% per annum on $47,200 up to the date of full settlement of $70,295.00. c) No order for Costs.
