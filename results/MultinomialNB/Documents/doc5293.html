In re-examination "purpose of free timber was of the big order. Plaintiff never told me the purpose of order. Analysis of the Evidence The Court noted the evidence that was tendered in through the respective witnesses for the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant misrepresented to him and as a result he suffered loss and should be compensated by the Defendant. The Plaintiff in his evidence stated that the Defendants salesman told him that the Pine posts were treated. The Defendants salesman denied this. The Plaintiff also relies on the Delivery Docket # 3576 which states that the Defendant Company is "stockist of: treated pine timber, treated pine post, treated kauvula..." The Defendants do not deny this. The Plaintiff also stated that he told the Defendants Salesman the purpose of the purchase of the pine posts. The Defendants denied this. The documentary evidence (Delivery Docket # 3576) that is before this Court is that the Plaintiff bought "pine post 14 length x 5" x 6" for $140.00". The Court notes that Delivery docket states that the Plaintiff bought 14 length pine post. The delivery docket does not state that it was treated or otherwise. It plainly states that 14 length pine posts were delivered to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has argued that he ordered treated pine post and that "when delivered I checked whether they were treated or not. They were treated. Could smell chemicals from the post." The Defendants all throughout have argued that the Plaintiff ordered untreated pine post and was supplied as per his order. The Plaintiff in cross examination told the Court he checked the posts upon delivery and they were treated as he smelled the chemicals from the posts. The Plaintiff also upon taking delivery would have looked at the delivery docket and noted his order and cross checked with delivery of the posts. The Court notes that the Plaintiff from his conduct of the trial is a knowledgeable person. He also seems to have an eye for details. He picked out from the Delivery docket that the Defendants were stockist of treated pine post. He surely would have scrutinised the delivery docket in detail and also noted that Defendant have on top of the delivery docket stated that they are "dealers in general native timber, pine and mahogany". In this part the Defendants make general reference that they deal with pine. They do not state only treated or otherwise. If the Plaintiff had ordered treated pine posts he would have made sure the delivery docket contained the words treated pine posts rather than just pine posts for the items he purchased. It would have greatly assisted the Plaintiff if he obtained and tendered evidence to this Court a chemical analysis report that the posts had in fact had chemicals in it and that it was treated and that despite it being treated the post rot after sometime. The photos that the Plaintiff has tendered are also of no value as they do not support the claim of the Plaintiff. They do not show any rotten post as is alleged by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has not tendered any evidence in Court that the post is rotten. No evidence was tendered in Court to support his claim that the post is rotten. The Court has noted the demeanour of all the witnesses in Court. The Defendants were thoroughly cross examined and they maintained that they supplied as per the order of the customer, the Plaintiff. They were credible and gave truthful responses in court and the Court accepts their evidence. The Court is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Defendants misrepresented to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiffs Claim fails. The Orders Plaintiffs Claim dismissed. 28 days to appeal.
