The Court convicted you for the offence you were charged with. 7.

(iv) The tariff for 'simple larceny', with a previous conviction of a felony, was held to be over 9 months.

The Court observes that you have pleaded guilty before a full hearing of the case hence you are entitled for a reduction of 6 months of your term of imprisonment which now stands to 12 months. 14. You are not a first offender and hence you are not entitled to the credit that is given to an offender with previous good character. 15. Therefore, your final term of imprisonment stands at 12 months. 16. The Court is mindful of the fact that a sentence below two (02) years could be suspended in terms of Section 26(2)(b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009, 17.
