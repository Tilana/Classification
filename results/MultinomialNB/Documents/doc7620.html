HAC 096 OF 2009S THE STATE vs 1. TADEO QARASAUMAKI 2. ASAELI KOROI 3. PENI WAQAKIBAU Counsels : Ms. L. Tabuakuro for the State Accused No. 1 in Person Accused No. 2 in Person Accused No. 3 in Person Hearings : 10th to 16th March, 2011 Summing Up : 18th March, 2011 Judgment : 18th March, 2011 JUDGMENT 1. Following a trial lasting approximately 5 days, the three assessors have returned with their opinions. On the "robbery with violence" charge, all the assessors have unanimously found accused No. 1 guilty as charged, and accused No. 2 and 3, not guilty as charged. On the "receiving stolen property" charge, the assessors have unanimously found all three accuseds guilty as charged. 2. I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. I find the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such conclusions on the evidence. Obviously, they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the prosecution's version of events, as far as accused No. 1 was concerned, on count No. 1. As far as accused No. 2 and 3 were concerned, on count No. 1, they have a reasonable doubt on their guilt. As far as the "receiving stolen property" charges, the assessors unanimously accepted the prosecution version of events. 3. I accept the opinions of the assessors and I find accused No. 1 guilty as charged on count No. 1, and I convict him accordingly. As for accused No. 2 and 3, I find them not guilty as charged, and I acquit them accordingly of count No. 1. 4. On count Nos. 2, 3 and 4, I accept the assessors' unanimous opinions and find all accused guilty as charged and I convict them accordingly on those counts.
