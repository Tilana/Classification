You sentence for the first count is 2 years 8 months. 13. For the second count considering the circumstances of offending and giving appropriate discount for mitigating factors I sentence you to 3 months imprisonment. 14.

I reduce 5 days for your time in custody thus your final sentence will be 2 years 7 months & 25 days. 15. I've considered whether to suspend your sentence. Although this is your first offence, the offending is prevalent in community and there is a need to impose a sentence to deter other would be offenders and also act as a lesson for you.
