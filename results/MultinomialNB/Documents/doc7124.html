I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors. I find that the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. Obviously, they accepted the prosecutions version of events on counts No. 1, 2, 3, and 7. The majority accepted the prosecution version of events on counts No.4 and 6. 5. On count No.1, the assessors accepted that the four accuseds broke into Ishwar Narayans residence, on 5th July 2008, between 1am and 2am. They accepted that the four accuseds threatened Ishwar Narayan and his wife with serious injuries, if they resisted. The assessors accepted that the four men stole $5,429 worth of properties, and fled in Mr. Narayans vehicle, "MEDIA 1". 6. On count No.2, the assessors accepted that the four accuseds unlawfully used Mr. Narayans vehicle, "MEDIA 1" when they fled in the same, and drove towards Suva Town House. 7. On count No.3, the assessors also accepted that the four accuseds, thereafter violently robbed receptionist Vitinia Tuisavura, of her gold chain, worth $150, and $600, in her custody, at Suva Town House Motel. 8. On count No.4, the assessors also accepted that accuseds No.1, 2 and 3 then proceeded to damage a pursuing police car, registration no. GN 356, when they rammed "MEDIA 1" into it, on 5th July 2008, shortly before 3am, after fleeing from Suva Town House. They also accepted that the group, attacked the police car by smashing its windscreen. A majority of two assessors (ie. assessor No. 2 and 3) also found that accused No.4 was part of the group. 9. On count No.5, the assessors unanimously found that accused No. 1 did not criminally intimidate Detective Constable Sachin Chand, on 5th July 2008. In a majority decision of two assessors (ie. assessor No.2 and 3), they also found that accuseds No. 2, 3 and 4 did not criminally intimidate Detective Constable Sachin Chand, at the time. 10. On count No. 6, the assessors accepted that accuseds No. 2 and 3 intentionally wounded Acting Corporal Mitieli Divarua when they struck him with pieces of timber and iron rods. In a majority decision of two assessors, they found accused No.1 and 4 were party to the attack on Acting Corporal Mitieli Divarua. 11. On count No.7, the assessors unanimously accepted that the four accuseds stole Ishwar Narayans Kenwood car stereo and CD changer, worth $2,000, when they abandoned "MEDIA 1", at Nasinu Secondary School, early morning on 5th July 2008. 12. I accept the assessors unanimous verdict of guilty as charged, on all four accuseds, on counts No.1, 2, 3 and 7. I find all four accuseds guilty as charged on counts No.1, 2, 3 and 7, and I convict each of them accordingly, on those counts. 13. On count No.4, the assessors unanimously found accuseds No.1, 2 and 3 guilty as charged. In a majority of two assessors to one, accused No.4 was found guilty as charged, on count no.4. I accept the assessors unanimous and majority decisions, and I therefore find all four accuseds guilty as charged, on count No.4. I convict them accordingly. 14. On count No.5, the assessors unanimously found accused No.1 not guilty as charged. In a majority of two assessors to one, accuseds No. 2, 3 and 4 were found not guilty as charged, on count No.5. I accept the assessors unanimous and majority decisions, and I therefore find all four accuseds not guilty as charged, on count No.5. I acquit them accordingly, on count No.5. 15. On count No.6, the assessors unanimously found accuseds No.2 and 3 guilty as charged. In a majority of two assessors to one, accuseds No.1 and 4 were found guilty as charged, on count No.6. I accept the assessors unanimous and majority decisions, and I therefore find all four accuseds guilty as charged, on count No.6. I convict them accordingly. 16. In summary, all accuseds are found guilty as charged on counts No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, and are convicted accordingly. All accuseds are found not guilty as charged on count No.5, and are acquitted accordingly. Salesi Temo Acting Judge AT Suva 21st April 2010</p></div></div></body></html>
