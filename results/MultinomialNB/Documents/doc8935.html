HBC0233 OF 2003L BETWEEN: MOHAMMED SUBHAN f/n Mohammed Jan Plaintiff AND: POST FIJI LIMITED and or FIJI POST TELECOMMUNICATION LIMITED a registered statutory and or corporate body having its registered office at Suva. Defendant Counsel: Mr. S. Krishna for Mr. G.P. Shankar for the plaintiff Mr. I. Fa for the defendant Date of Hearing & Judgment: 2 November 2004 EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT In this matter, the plaintiff applies by way of Summons for the extension of the Writ of Summons pursuant to Order 6 Rule 7(2) of the High Court Rules. The Writ of Summons alleges that the plaintiff was on the 9th April 1993 wrongfully and unlawfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant and it is that wrongful dismissal, that is, the basis of the claim against the defendant. On the 18th July 2003, a Summons was heard by Mr. Justice Byrne, following which, leave was granted to issue the Writ of Summons against the defendant. It appears that the Writ of Summons was then filed pursuant to that Order but was in fact not uplifted from the Registry for service prior to the expiration of the Writ. It would appear that it is now 11 years since the cause of action arose. As I have said, the application is made pursuant to Order 6 Rule 7(2). Whilst it might appear patently obvious that the writ should not be extended, some guidance might also be sort by reference to the Whitebook (1991 ed.) at p. 56 under reference 6/8/3 which gives examples of reasons, which have been held to be bad and one of those reasons is carelessness. It appears to me that no action could be more careless than the actions on behalf of the plaintiff in this matter, where leave was granted and then the Writ issued pursuant to that leave was not uplifted and served within the time allowed by the Rules and for those reasons, the Summons to extend is dismissed. Order 1. Summons dismissed. 2. The plaintiff to pay the defendants costs which I assess in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
