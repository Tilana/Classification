Lacanivalu for the State Date of Ruling : 8 February 2013 BAIL RULING [1] This is an application for bail filed by the Applicant above named. [2] The Applicant above named submits following grounds in support of his bail application: (a) He did not sign the caution interview and charge statement; (b) He was tortured; (c) He is innocent; (d) Have dependant de facto wife and a 7 year old child. [3] The State Counsel objects for bail and submits following grounds: (a) The Applicant has two cases of similar nature before the High Court (HAC 133 of 2012 and HAC 138 of 2012); (b) In HAC 133 of 2012 on the 18th September 2012 at around 11.30pm the Applicant with two others allegedly boarded a taxi, threatened the driver with a knife and robbed his items and dumped him in the boot of his own taxi; (c) In HAC 138 of 2012 the Applicant together with two others allegedly broke and entered to two rooms at a Airport hotel in Nadi which was occupied by tourists stole items worth more than $8,900.00; (d) The Applicant may not surrender to custody; (e) Public interest and protection of the community. [4] Section 3(1) of the Bail Act states as follows: "Every accused person has a right to be released on bail, unless it is not in the interests of justice that bail should be granted". [5] Considering the application and the response filed by the Respondent State I find the Applicant alleged to have committed serious offences. In both cases the victims are very sensitive persons. Both of them raises public concern. [6] I find the Applicant falls within the ambit of Section 19 of the Bail Act. Hence I find releasing the Applicant on bail is a threat to the community. [7] For the reasons discussed above I find the presumption of bail is successfully rebutted hence I refuse bail. [8] Application for bail is dismissed. S.
