HBC0061 OF 2005 BETWEEN: MILTON ROSS DUBE JOHN DEDABANOUW DUBE NINA KATHLEEN DUBE PLAINTIFFS AND: KRISTAMMA GOUNDER 1ST DEFENDANT HARI KRISHNA GOUNDER 2ND DEFENDANT THE REGISTRAR OF TITLES, SUVA 3RD DEFENDANT Mr D S Naidu for the Plaintiffs Mr G P Shankar for 1st and 2nd Defendants Ms S. Tabaiwalu for 3rd Defendant. Date of Hearing: 24 May 2005 Dates of Submissions: 31 May, 7 June and 14 June 2005 Date of Ruling: 05 August 2005 INTERLOCUTORY RULING OF FINNIGAN J The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings by writ on 10 March this year. The same day I granted ex-parte interim injunctions against the Defendants and directed service of all the papers for appearances by the parties on 18 March 2005. The 1st and 2nd Defendants, even as described in the writ, live in New Zealand and Australia. On 18 March 2005 Plaintiffs Counsel acknowledged that fact and advised that Mr G P Shankar acts as Counsel for the Defendants but did not know whether the Defendants had instructed him in the present matter. I directed service on Mr G P Shankar. Mr Shankar does not acknowledge service. To the contrary, he promptly filed on 23 March 2005 a summons seeking to have the entire write of summons set aside and in the alternative an order for security for costs since he claims the Plaintiffs live overseas. I have had written submissions and Counsel have supplied their authorities. The application for security for costs I hereby adjourn sine die. It will be dealt with on its merits later should that be necessary. In the meantime it is plain the 1st and 2nd Defendants have not been served with the proceedings. If Mr Shankar had refused service, the attention of both parties and of the Court would not have been diverted to technicalities and authorities that are no more then a distraction from the main issues. I direct that the Plaintiff must serve the 1st and 2nd Defendants in accordance with the High Court Rules. I make no determinations about how that is to be done. It is a matter for the Plaintiffs. The writ is alive until 9 March 2006 and I leave it to them to get on with it. Further application to the Court may be necessary. The interim injunctions against the Defendants remain in force until further order of the Court. I make no order for costs. D.D. Finnigan JUDGE At Lautoka 05 August 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
