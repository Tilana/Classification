The Counsel for the Plaintiff stated that the truck the 2nd Defence witness drove is not mentioned in the Defence pleadings or evidence. Analysis of the Evidence The Defences first witness the Director of the Defendant company, Mr Surya Deo Sharma does not deny owing the Plaintiff money. The Plaintiffs had tendered evidence to prove its claim against the Defendant for their part. The Plaintiffs claim is proven. The Defendants in their defence and counter claim state that they did not pay because the fuel was of inferior quality and it caused damage to its vehicle. The Defendants in their pleadings stated that "as a result of the contaminated fuel supplied by the Plaintiff, four of the companys trucks registration no. DW644, DY213, EF082 and EU 706 fuel pumps and its components were extensively damaged". The defence submitted 4 photos stating it to be of fuel pumps and the last one to be of the excavator fuel pump break down. In fact the last photo does not show a fuel pump but an Excavator bearing number plate EF 826. In its pleading the Defendants stated that they repaired fuel pumps of 4 excavators for $7000.00. There is no supporting invoice or evidence of this at the hearing. The photos did not assist the Court. From the photos it could not be ascertained which vehicles the parts belonged to and what components the components in the photos were. In fact the photo of the Excavator does not prove anything. No evidence was led that it even belonged to the Defendant. A mere photo with no evidence as to its taker, date photo was taken, identity of the component and the vehicle do not assist the Defendant. The last photo only shows an excavator without a bucket? What inference the Defence expects the court to draw from this photo. No invoice or quotes were tendered for repairs of fuel pumps of 4 excavators as pleaded. The Defendants have submitted quotes by Diesel Turbo EFI (Fiji) Ltd for vehicle numbers: FF826, DW 664, EW 978, EF006, EX809 and EU706 dated 1st August 2009. The defendants have tendered no evidence (by way of LTA vehicle Search) that they own these vehicles. In fact in the pleadings the Defendants state only about EU 706, but for none of the other vehicles mentioned in the pleadings has a quote been provided for. One tax invoice was tendered dated 30th October 2007 to service and calibrate 1 x 8 cylinder inline fuel pump #106891-1334 at a cost of $965.25 purportedly for EU706 which is written in pen (by someone) as the invoice portion relating to vehicle number is blank. A Tax invoice was also submitted dated 17th August 2005 for service of EF082 for $800.00. The Court notes the alleged contaminated fuel supplied by the Plaintiff was in 2006. The Vehicle EF082 fuel pump was serviced prior to the supply of the fuel in 2006 and the allegation of contamination. The Defendant has given evidence that their vehicles fuel pumps were repaired prior to the supply of fuel by the Plaintiff in 2006. The driver of the Defendant drove vehicle number EH395 which he told the Court choked 10 times. The Defendants 1st witness did not state he owned this vehicle and neither is this stated in the pleadings. The Defendants counter claim is not supported by the evidence that it has tendered. The Defendant in support of its case could have brought in evidence of those who repaired the fuel pumps to state it was contaminated by water and dirt. No such evidence was tendered. The court also notes that the Plaintiff presented a cheque twice and this supports its argument that they were asked to re-present the cheque. They would not have done so if they knew the payment for the cheque was stopped as they Defendant complained about the quality of the fuel. The Court accepts the fact that the Defendants told that Plaintiffs to re-present the cheques as they did not have funds, which the Plaintiffs did. The Defendants did not stop the payments for the cheques for the supply of inferior quality of fuel. They did not have funds to pay for the supply of the fuel. No conclusive evidence was tendered in Court that the alleged damage to the Plaintiffs vehicle was caused by the fuel supplied by the Plaintiff. The Court noted the evidence tendered in Court. The Court noted the demeanor of the witnesses. The Court believes the evidence of the Defendants 2nd witness. The Defendants driver. He was truthful. The 1st Defendant witness was selective. He was not truthful. He also contradicted his evidence. The Plaintiffs claim against the Defendant succeeds. The Defendants counter claim is dismissed. Right to appeal.
