It has further scrutinized the documents that were tendered in Court together with the submission that was made. This Court has also had the privilege of reading the ruling of the Master as regards the Winding up action. The claim by the Plaintiff is for monies due and owing to them by the Defendant Company. The 3rd witness for the Defence is the Director of the Defendant Company and his position is that the Plaintiffs owe him money and he had an agreement with Amrit Ram to offset the Plaintiffs claim. Manoj Kumar in his evidence does not deny asking the Plaintiffs to make the payments. He stated that it was a personal request by him. This Court has noted that all the invoices that were paid, were paid for Teltec and as is stated in evidence of Manoj Kumar upon his direction. Manoj Kumar is the Director of Teltec and he asked payments be paid for Teltec. This Court from the evidence in Court is satisfied that Manoj Kumar, as Director of the Defendant Company asked the Plaintiffs to pay the dues for Teltec. This Court has noted the claim by Manoj Kumar that there exists an agreement dated 1st May 2006 to offset the sums due to each other. No originals were tendered in Court. Manoj stated that Amrit brought in 2 copies and he took a photocopy after the signing and Amrit had the 2 originals. This Court does not believe Manoj Kumar that he would have taken a photocopy if 2 originals existed after signing. This Court finds that the purported agreement of 1st May 2006 is fabricated. In fact the Court notes that Manoj Kumar signed on Teltec letterheads dated 30th April 2007 that he regretted not being able to pay the loan due to Amrit Ram. This Court has also noted the Manoj signing on Teltec letterhead dated 2nd March 2007 apologizing for the delay in paying the loan. This Court finds odd that Manoj would after signing an agreement to offset the sums would later sign on company letterhead regretting and apologizing for sums due to the Plaintiff. From the evidence tendered in Court this Court is satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved their claim against the Defendant company. Manoj Kumar who is alleging that the Plaintiff's owe him and was supposed to be offset has not provided any receipts of the payments he is alleging he made for or on behalf of the Plaintiffs. In fact he is not truthful as can be found from the evidence of Vijen, an independent witness who told this Court that Amnit went by himself to see Manoj. When Manoj stated in Court that he gave the money in presence of Vijen. This Court from the hearing finds that this agreement relied upon by the initiated by Manoj is fabricated and forged to advance his cause. This Court has accepted the evidence of the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs succeed with their claim. This Court Orders as follows: (a) The Defendant is to pay Plaintiffs a sum of $17,469.32 (Australian Dollars) together with interest at the rate of 25% per month from 30th March 2007 until payment and the total sum shall not exceed $50,000.00. (b) The Defendant to pay the Plaintiff a sum of $1000 as costs for this action. (c) The Defendant is to pay the sum claimed and costs with 28 days 28 days to appeal.
