State Counsel moved time till the following day to file the Summary of Facts. When the case mentioned on the next day I asked whether they are still maintaining their plea of guilty. 1st and 2nd Accused persons answered affirmatively, but the 3rd Accused moved Court to withdraw his plea. Further the 1st and 2nd Accused persons admitted to the Summary of Facts. 5 Being convinced with the plea of the 1st and 2nd Accused to be unequivocal I found both Accused persons guilty and convicted them as charged. 6 According to the Summary of Facts on the 29th March 2012 the Complainant Huong Zu Jin closed his shop Ken's Shop Mart situated at Nakavu, Nadi due to the floods on that area. He returned to his shop only on the 31st March 2012. There he had discovered his shop was broken and items worth of $18,027.00 was stolen.

At the Police investigation it was found that 1st and 2nd Accused and another person was lavishly drinking and spending money on their own. Police had arrested them and recovered items worth of $42.10.
