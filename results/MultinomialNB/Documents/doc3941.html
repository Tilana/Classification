App. No: HAA0073 of 2005S Between: LUKE NAVUDA; JOSEVA TUKANA; SEVANAIA DONU; SAIMONI LOGA; FILIPE WILIKIBAU; and APOROSA TUITOKOVA Appellants And: THE STATE Respondent Hearing: 16th September 2005 Judgment: 30th September 2005 Counsel: Ms B. Malimali for Appellants Mr. A. Rayawa for State JUDGMENT The Appellants appeal against conviction on one count of throwing object and one count (for the 3rd Appellant) of Arson. It was alleged that on the 1st of March 2005 at Malawai, Gau, they wilfully threw stones at the house of Laisenia Bale and that the 3rd Appellant wilfully and unlawfully set fire to the house of Laisenia Bale. As in HAA0067 of 2005 and HAA0070 of 2005, the case was first called on the 8th of March. The charges were read and explained and they were understood. The Appellants said they admitted the charges of their own free will. The matter was adjourned to the 11th of March, when all Appellants were asked again if they pleaded guilty and if anyone had forced them to plea. They said that no one had. The facts were read. They were that between 1am and 2am on the 1st of March 2005, the Appellants were drinking a bucket of homebrew. They then went to the victims house. The victim was asleep with a friend and his family. The Appellants began to throw stones at the house causing damage to the windows and the interior. The 4th Appellant then set fire to the house by lighting a window curtain. The victim and his family managed to put the fire out. The Appellants apparently believed that the victim was a witchdoctor and that he also claimed to be the holder of a chiefly title. The victims family took shelter with neighbours and the Appellant then left. The matter was reported to the police by the turaga-ni-koro. Under caution the Appellants admitted the offences. These facts were admitted. The Appellants (except for the 5th Appellant) were first offenders. The 5th Appellant had one previous conviction in 2002 for shopbreaking entering and larceny. In mitigation, the 1st Appellant said that he was 20 years old and only educated up to Class 8. He expressed remorse and said he would not re-offend. The 2nd appellant said he was 19 years old and educated up to Form 4. He also expressed remorse. The 3rd Appellant was 17 years old and educated up to Form 5. He expressed remorse and promised not to re-offend. The 4th Appellant was 17 years old and expressed remorse. The 5th Appellant was 22 years old and educated up to Form 3. He asked for forgiveness. The 6th Appellant was 19 years old and educated up to Form 3. Sentence was delivered on the 14th of April 2005. The learned Magistrate said that after taking the aggravating and mitigating factors into account, the Appellants were sentenced to years imprisonment on Count 1, and for the 4th Appellant, to 5 years imprisonment on Count 2. The Appellants now appeal against conviction saying that their pleas were not unequivocal. Their counsel points to their lack of representation, their lack of familiarity with the court system, their lack of understanding of the charges and the elements of the offence, and their allegations of police pressure. For the same reasons I have given in their other two appeals (HAA0067 of 2005 and HAA0070 of 2005) I am not persuaded that the convictions should be set aside. The Court record shows that the Appellants were told of the nature of the charges. They were asked if there was any pressure put on them to plead guilty. They were asked if they understood the charges. The sentencing hearing was adjourned to another day so the Appellants had ample time to reconsider their positions. They did not do so. They maintained their pleas. The facts disclose both offences and the pleas were unequivocal. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. I will now hear appeal against sentence.
