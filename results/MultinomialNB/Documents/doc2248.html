HBM 05 OF 2007 NO. 49 OF 2007 BETWEEN NAND JAINESH Applicant AND NARAYAN KARISHMA K Respondent Appearances: R. Gordon for the applicant No Appearance for the respondent Date of Hearing: 23 April 2007 Date of Decision: 23 April 2007 Extempore Ruling [1] Having considered the evidence, I am of the view that the applicant has satisfied the requirements of Section 32 (2) (d) (i) of the Family Law Act 18 of 2003, in that neither party to the marriage of 4 July 2005 gave real consent. Clearly both Jainesh and Karishma were under duress of their respective parents to enter into a union, neither of them having given real consent or having much to do with it. The applicant, although a professional has left me with a clear impression that he was compelled to marry Karishma because of family pressure. He cannot be said to have freely consented at the time. I am satisfied his consent was obtained through duress. [2] I grant an order of nullity of the marriage on the ground that the marriage is void for reasons aforesaid. Gwen Phillips JUDGE At Lautoka 23 April 2007</p></div></div></body></html>
