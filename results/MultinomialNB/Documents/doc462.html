(z) The applicant has filed his formal stay applications for proceedings against him and filed on the 17th March 2011 on the grounds of delay by the court systems in this case. The Law In R v Derby Crown Court, exp Brooks [1984] 80 Cr. App. R. 164, Sir Roger Ormrod said: "The power to stop a prosecution arises only when it is an abuse of the process of the court. It may be an abuse of processes if either (a) the prosecution have manipulated or misused the process of the court so as to deprive the defendant of a protection provided by law or to take unfair advantage of a technicality, or (b) on the balance of probability the defendant has been, or will be, prejudiced in the prosecution of or conduct of his defence by delay on the part of the prosecution which is unjustifiable: for example, not due to the complexity of the inquiry and preparation of the prosecution case, or to the action of the defendant or his co-accused or to genuine difficulty in effecting service". The inherent power to stay criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process has long been recognized in common Law. But it should only be employed in exceptional circumstances (State v Waisale Rokotuiwai HAC 009 of 1995). In case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Jackaran Tokai and others (Trinidad and Tobago)[1996] (12th June 1996) Privy Council Appeal No.53 of 1995 (Judgment delivered on 12th June, 1996). Their Lordships said: "However, we remind ourselves of the principles outlined earlier in this judgment and the observation of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] A.C.1254,1304, that: 'generally speaking a prosecutor has as much right as a defendant to demand a verdict of a jury on an outstanding indictment, and where either demands a verdict a judge has no jurisdiction to stand in the way of it'. Stays imposed on the grounds of delay or for any other reason should only be employed in exceptional circumstances. If they were to become a matter of routine, it would be only a short time before the public, understandably, viewed the process with suspicion and mistrust. We respectfully adopt the reasoning of Brennan J. in Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 C.L.R. 23. In principle, therefore, even where the delay can be said to be unjustifiable, the imposition of a Permanent Stay should be the exception rather than the rule. Still more rare should be cases where a stay can properly be imposed in the absence of any fault on the part of the complainant or prosecution. Delay due merely to the complexity of the case or contributed to by the actions of the defendant himself should never be the foundation for a stay. In answer to the second question posed by the Attorney-General, no stay should be imposed unless the defendant shows on the balance of probabilities that owing to the delay he will suffer serious prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held: in other words, that the continuance of the prosecution amounts to a misuse of the process of the court. In assessing whether there is likely to be prejudice and if so whether it can properly be described as serious, the following matters should be borne in mind: first, the power of the judge at common law and under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to regulate the admissibility of evidence; secondly, the trial process itself, which should ensure that all relevant factual issues arising from delay will be placed before the jury as part of the evidence for their consideration, together with the powers of the judge to give appropriate directions to the jury before they consider their verdict." In this case the applicant was first produced before the Nausori Magistrates Court on 2nd November 2005 and therefore the delay is more than five years. When you peruse the chronology of events the delay has been mostly caused by the accused applicant and the co-accused. There had been certain amount of delay due to the Magistrate no longer sitting after 15/2/10, which was beyond the control of the court. As it was said in case of Brennan J in Jago v District Court of New South Wales (Supra), delay due merely to the complexity of the case or contributed to by the actions of the defendant himself should never be the foundation for stay. Mere delay cannot be considered as abuse of process. The applicant has failed to satisfy court that the delay has caused prejudice his defence or that the applicant cannot be tried fairly. Therefore the application for permanent stay is refused. The learned Magistrate is directed to hear and determine this case expeditiously. Registrar is directed to forward a copy of this ruling forthwith to the Magistrate, Nausori. Priyantha Fernando JUDGE At Suva 27th April, 2011.</p></div></div></body></html>
