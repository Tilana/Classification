In my judgment dated 9th October, 2012, I found that it did not appear that this consent had been obtained by the plaintiff and I made order as follows: upon the plaintiff obtaining the consent of the Director of Lands under 13(1) of the State Lands Act(cap 132) . a. Memorials numbered 428466,503510 and 694615 be expunged from State Lease No.8165. b. The 6th defendant provide the plaintiff with an unencumbered and indefeasible title. Upon delivery of my judgment on 9th October, 2012, Mr Sunil Kumar, counsel for the plaintiff, submitted that the consent of the Director of Lands was not required, in respect of a discharge of mortgage. I have now verified from the iTaukei Land Trust Board that the consent of the Director of Lands is not required, in respect of a discharge of mortgage of native land. In these circumstances, my judgment dated 9th October, 2012, has to be varied to the extent that the consent of the Director of Lands is not required for the discharge of Memorials numbered 428466,503510 and 694615 .
